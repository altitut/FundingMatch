          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled software tool to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment planning of U.S Department of Defense (DoD) cargo across a variety of container types. The solution must enhance agility, reduce packing time, and integrate maintenance and load planning actions while functioning in contested, disconnected, or coalition environments. It should support activity tracking, intelligent inventory mapping, and dynamic, on-the-fly reconfiguration based on real-time operational inputs. The system should allow user-friendly interaction through advanced Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), offer edge compute capabilities, and be adaptable to different user needs, cargo types, and mission constraints. The end goal is a scalable, dual-use tool that enhances mission readiness while also offering commercial logistics value.   DESCRIPTION: Space Logistics cargo operations—such as those involving Readiness Spares Packages (RSPs)—are vital to enabling the U.S. Space Force (USSF) to respond quickly to crises, contingencies, or emerging mission requirements. These operations rely on containerized systems (e.g., ISU-90s, 463L pallets, and custom bins or boxes) to preposition equipment, spares, and supplies. However, the current process for preparing and packing these systems is time-consuming, largely manual, and prone to errors, which limits readiness and agility. The USSF is seeking an innovative AI-enabled solution to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment of cargo containers for movement to forward locations or spaceports. The desired tool should:   - Significantly reduce packing time and errors;  - Optimize spatial usage, weight distribution, and container selection;  - Provide real-time visibility into packing activity and container contents; and  - Integrate maintenance and load planning considerations into the cargo configuration process.   The system should ingest standard logistics data, such as National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and UTC (Unit Type Code) information from Major Command (MAJCOM) or Field Command (FLDCOM) sources, and output detailed container-level packing plans. It must support various container formats, be adaptable to different cargo profiles (including hazardous or classified items), and provide activity tracking and operational alerts to assist planners and personnel throughout the pack-out process. Solutions should prioritize user-centered design, enabling intuitive interaction through advanced HMI such as voice recognition, touch screens, or augment reality/virtual reality (AR/VR). The tool must be operable in contested or communications-degraded environments, offering edge-computing capabilities and the ability to sync with central systems when reconnected. This capability will directly enhance the USSF’s ability to execute rapid, distributed logistics operations with reduced cognitive burden on Airmen and Guardians. The topic is intended to stimulate innovative research and development (R&D) toward a dual-use solution with strong applicability in both defense and commercial logistics sectors   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Phase II goal is to develop and demonstrate a functional prototype system that addresses the USSF’s need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cargo packing and load planning for deployment and sustainment operations. The prototype should enable more rapid and accurate configuration of cargo across a range of container types and operational scenarios. It should support improved planning, activity tracking, and information flow in environments that may have limited communications or require flexibility for changing mission conditions. Phase II work is expected to include:   - Prototype Development: build a working software prototype that supports optimized planning and configuration of cargo. The system should accommodate various data inputs and packing constraints, including space, weight, timing, and priority of items.  - Operational Integration Context: demonstrate the prototype’s ability to support logistics personnel during cargo preparation and movement activities. This may include generating container-specific outputs, supporting real-time updates, or aligning with mission support functions such as maintenance scheduling or readiness tracking.  - Evaluation in Relevant Environment: develop a test plan and evaluate the prototype in an operationally representative setting. Capture performance metrics such as time reduction, accuracy of packing plans, user workload reduction, or adaptability to mission constraints.  - Transition Planning and Dual-Use Considerations: begin to define potential transition pathways, including DoD logistics operations and commercial applications. Consider compatibility with existing systems and outline next steps for operational deployment or commercial scaling.   Deliverables for Phase II may include:  - A functioning prototype software system;  - A technical report describing system capabilities, interfaces, and performance results;  - A summary of evaluation outcomes and user feedback;  - Documentation to support transition or further development;  - A commercialization and transition strategy aligned with potential military and commercial applications.   Phase II will deliver a validated prototype system that enables more efficient, informed, and agile cargo packing and planning. The solution should enhance operational readiness, reduce time and error in the packing process, and support integration with broader logistics and sustainment activities.   To facilitate the potential transition from Phase II to Phase III, a transition plan will be developed that outlines the steps necessary to ensure that the optimization solution is deployed and used effectively by government and commercial partners. The plan will include a timeline for deployment, a plan for identifying potential partners and customers, and a plan for marketing and selling the solution. The plan will also include a detailed description of the integration plan, and any necessary modifications or customizations needed to make the solution compatible with existing systems.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort for the RSP Optimization for Efficient Deployment SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization. The developed technology has dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. Military applications include RSP deployment and other supply chain management operations, as well as maintenance and load planning actions. The technology can help the military optimize its logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Commercial applications manufacturing, and distribution. The technology can help commercial organizations optimize their logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.   The expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, with a well-defined and validated software solution ready for commercialization. The technology will have been tested and validated in realistic environments, and any necessary modifications or customizations will have been made to ensure that it is compatible with existing systems and workflows. Additional information regarding transition planning includes identifying known government approvals required for deployment and any additional opportunities for deployment of the optimization solution within the government and commercial sectors. The integration plan will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure that the optimization solution is integrated seamlessly into their existing systems and workflows.   Overall, the expected Phase III effort for the ASTROPAC SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization, with dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. The expected TRL at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, and the transition planning will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure seamless integration into existing systems and workflows.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to develop a scalable, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled decision-support framework that enables faster, more informed prioritization of emerging technologies across the space sustainment and logistics enterprise. Project AXIS 54 will equip cross-functional teams with structured tools to assess innovation alignment, technical maturity, and operational relevance—reducing transition friction and accelerating mission-impactful capabilities. The Phase I objective is to design and validate core framework components, AI integration pathways, and representative use cases to guide prototype development in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Modern defense innovation often excels at the edge but stalls at the center—where promising technologies struggle to transition due to fragmented visibility, misaligned priorities, and lack of actionable evaluation tools. From concept to prototype, many initiatives fail to bridge the gap between innovation and operational impact. Project AXIS 54 addresses this challenge by delivering a practical, AI-enabled framework to assess, prioritize, and align emerging technologies with mission objectives. Designed for use by capability developers, acquisition teams, and decision-makers across the space logistics and sustainment enterprise, AXIS 54 will support:   - Scoring and visualization of initiatives based on operational relevance, technical maturity, transition readiness, and system feasibility.  - Warfighter-centric planning using intuitive visual models that promote alignment across stakeholders.  - Feedback loops that track early-stage innovations and guide them toward successful integration.   AI will serve as a core enabler, automating pattern recognition across portfolios, flagging integration risks, and surfacing dependencies. Machine learning models will continuously refine prioritization logic using real-world datasets, improving insight fidelity and accelerating informed decision-making. Aligned with the Secretary of Defense’s 17 priority areas—including readiness, innovation speed, and ecosystem resilience—AXIS 54 enables structured yet flexible evaluation of technology portfolios. It empowers leaders to elevate the most mission-relevant innovations, reinforcing readiness and sustainment in support of high-priority U.S. Space Force (USSF) operations. Instead of delivering a rigid platform, AXIS 54 will offer a modular toolkit—scalable for enterprise planning and adaptable for agile experimentation teams. It ensures that initiatives with the greatest potential for lethality, agility, and sustainability are identified early, matured strategically, and transitioned efficiently.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to establish the foundational elements of a modular decision-support toolkit that enables cross-functional teams to assess, align, and communicate the operational value of emerging technologies. Phase I focuses on validating a scalable, AI-enabled framework that helps prioritize innovation efforts in alignment with Space Systems Command (SSC), SpaceWERX, and broader USSF mission objectives. The scope and key tasks for this Phase I effort include:    1. Framework Blueprint Development – Design a practical scoring and assessment model incorporating real-world evaluation criteria—such as value-to-mission, maturity level, transition feasibility, and sustainment impact—used by SSC/S4 and innovation stakeholders.  2. Use Case Mapping – Apply the framework to representative scenarios drawn from current innovation pipelines (e.g., autonomous logistics, orbital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), digital sustainment), validating its applicability across diverse technology verticals.  3. Interface Prototypes – Create initial interface mockups or functional wireframes that demonstrate how program managers, acquisition officers, and mission owners would interact with the toolkit for planning and decision-making.  4. AI/machine learning (ML) System Architecture – Define AI design elements, including recommended data structures, training datasets, pattern recognition methods, and inference logic to be developed in Phase II.  5. Transition Touchpoints Identification – Identify ideal pilot environments and stakeholder communities for Phase II implementation, including where and how the system will be integrated into operational workflows.   Deliverables may include:  - Architecture and scoring model documentation.  - Scenario-based walkthroughs illustrating framework application.  - Mockups or interactive wireframes for user interface concepts.  - Initial AI/ML system design overview and recommended datasets.  - Phase II pilot strategy and stakeholder engagement plan.   PHASE II: The objective for Phase II is to develop and deliver a functional, AI-enabled prototype of the AXIS 54 framework that supports enterprise-level innovation planning, technology prioritization, and transition decision-making. The system will be co-developed with a government partner—such as SSC/S4, SpaceWERX, or a relevant program office—to ensure alignment with mission needs and real-world operational workflows. Consider the following during the Phase II approach:   - Collaborative Development: Work closely with government stakeholders to tailor the toolkit’s capabilities to actual use cases, workflows, and decision environments. This ensures the tool enhances—not disrupts—existing processes for capability planning and tech transition.  - AI/ML Integration: Deploy and train machine learning models using curated, relevant datasets to support prioritization scoring, dependency mapping, and readiness forecasting. Emphasis will be placed on explainability, transparency, and user trust.  - Operational Use Cases: Apply the prototype to live or recent innovation efforts (e.g., Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) portfolios, non-Program of Record (non-POR) pathfinders) to demonstrate its effectiveness in streamlining evaluations, surfacing transition risks, and identifying portfolio synergies.  - User-Centered Design: Refine visual interfaces, dashboards, and interaction pathways based on feedback from capability developers, program managers (PMs), and mission owners to ensure usability and adoption.   Deliverables may include:  - Fully functional AXIS 54 prototype system.  - Integrated AI/ML modules for initiative scoring, risk flagging, and value analysis.  - Pilot demonstrations in one or more operational environments.  - Stakeholder feedback report and performance evaluation.  - Phase III transition plan with pathways for broader DoD and commercial adoption.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III, military applications include:   - Strengthens strategic technology insertion and long-term sustainment planning across SSC portfolios.  - Institutionalizes repeatable transition pathways for SBIR/STTR efforts, Pathfinder projects, and other innovation pipelines.  - Provides Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and acquisition leaders with visibility into technology value, maturity, and risk throughout the development lifecycle.  - Enables structured evaluation and integration of non-POR capabilities that offer high operational value to the warfighter.  - Leverages AI/ML to surface emerging opportunities, flag integration risks, and support real-time, enterprise-level trade-off analysis.   Commercial applications may include:  - Highly applicable to organizations managing complex research and development (R&D) pipelines, particularly those with dual-use technology portfolios.  - Supports strategic planning and prioritization in commercial aerospace, spaceport logistics, advanced manufacturing, and defense-adjacent sectors.  - Improves communication and alignment between technical, operational, and business leadership in innovation-centric enterprises.  - Offers AI-driven portfolio analytics and insights to enhance innovation strategy, reduce investment risk, and accelerate time-to-market.   For transition pathways, the government opportunities may involve the adoption through SSC, SpaceWERX, and/or other innovation-focused DoD entities. Private sector opportunities may involve commercial deployment through SaaS or enterprise software licensing for R&D strategy, innovation portfolio management, and investment planning.   Ultimately, AXIS 54 bridges the gap between innovation and implementation—equipping both military and commercial decision-makers with a robust, AI-enabled framework to make faster, more informed decisions about which technologies to advance and how best to deploy them.

          "Topic Title": "Project AXIS 54: AI-Enabled Framework for Space Sustainment Technology Prioritization",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to develop a scalable, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled decision-support framework that enables faster, more informed prioritization of emerging technologies across the space sustainment and logistics enterprise. Project AXIS 54 will equip cross-functional teams with structured tools to assess innovation alignment, technical maturity, and operational relevance—reducing transition friction and accelerating mission-impactful capabilities. The Phase I objective is to design and validate core framework components, AI integration pathways, and representative use cases to guide prototype development in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Modern defense innovation often excels at the edge but stalls at the center—where promising technologies struggle to transition due to fragmented visibility, misaligned priorities, and lack of actionable evaluation tools. From concept to prototype, many initiatives fail to bridge the gap between innovation and operational impact. Project AXIS 54 addresses this challenge by delivering a practical, AI-enabled framework to assess, prioritize, and align emerging technologies with mission objectives. Designed for use by capability developers, acquisition teams, and decision-makers across the space logistics and sustainment enterprise, AXIS 54 will support:   - Scoring and visualization of initiatives based on operational relevance, technical maturity, transition readiness, and system feasibility.  - Warfighter-centric planning using intuitive visual models that promote alignment across stakeholders.  - Feedback loops that track early-stage innovations and guide them toward successful integration.   AI will serve as a core enabler, automating pattern recognition across portfolios, flagging integration risks, and surfacing dependencies. Machine learning models will continuously refine prioritization logic using real-world datasets, improving insight fidelity and accelerating informed decision-making. Aligned with the Secretary of Defense’s 17 priority areas—including readiness, innovation speed, and ecosystem resilience—AXIS 54 enables structured yet flexible evaluation of technology portfolios. It empowers leaders to elevate the most mission-relevant innovations, reinforcing readiness and sustainment in support of high-priority U.S. Space Force (USSF) operations. Instead of delivering a rigid platform, AXIS 54 will offer a modular toolkit—scalable for enterprise planning and adaptable for agile experimentation teams. It ensures that initiatives with the greatest potential for lethality, agility, and sustainability are identified early, matured strategically, and transitioned efficiently.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to establish the foundational elements of a modular decision-support toolkit that enables cross-functional teams to assess, align, and communicate the operational value of emerging technologies. Phase I focuses on validating a scalable, AI-enabled framework that helps prioritize innovation efforts in alignment with Space Systems Command (SSC), SpaceWERX, and broader USSF mission objectives. The scope and key tasks for this Phase I effort include:    1. Framework Blueprint Development – Design a practical scoring and assessment model incorporating real-world evaluation criteria—such as value-to-mission, maturity level, transition feasibility, and sustainment impact—used by SSC/S4 and innovation stakeholders.  2. Use Case Mapping – Apply the framework to representative scenarios drawn from current innovation pipelines (e.g., autonomous logistics, orbital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), digital sustainment), validating its applicability across diverse technology verticals.  3. Interface Prototypes – Create initial interface mockups or functional wireframes that demonstrate how program managers, acquisition officers, and mission owners would interact with the toolkit for planning and decision-making.  4. AI/machine learning (ML) System Architecture – Define AI design elements, including recommended data structures, training datasets, pattern recognition methods, and inference logic to be developed in Phase II.  5. Transition Touchpoints Identification – Identify ideal pilot environments and stakeholder communities for Phase II implementation, including where and how the system will be integrated into operational workflows.   Deliverables may include:  - Architecture and scoring model documentation.  - Scenario-based walkthroughs illustrating framework application.  - Mockups or interactive wireframes for user interface concepts.  - Initial AI/ML system design overview and recommended datasets.  - Phase II pilot strategy and stakeholder engagement plan.   PHASE II: The objective for Phase II is to develop and deliver a functional, AI-enabled prototype of the AXIS 54 framework that supports enterprise-level innovation planning, technology prioritization, and transition decision-making. The system will be co-developed with a government partner—such as SSC/S4, SpaceWERX, or a relevant program office—to ensure alignment with mission needs and real-world operational workflows. Consider the following during the Phase II approach:   - Collaborative Development: Work closely with government stakeholders to tailor the toolkit’s capabilities to actual use cases, workflows, and decision environments. This ensures the tool enhances—not disrupts—existing processes for capability planning and tech transition.  - AI/ML Integration: Deploy and train machine learning models using curated, relevant datasets to support prioritization scoring, dependency mapping, and readiness forecasting. Emphasis will be placed on explainability, transparency, and user trust.  - Operational Use Cases: Apply the prototype to live or recent innovation efforts (e.g., Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) portfolios, non-Program of Record (non-POR) pathfinders) to demonstrate its effectiveness in streamlining evaluations, surfacing transition risks, and identifying portfolio synergies.  - User-Centered Design: Refine visual interfaces, dashboards, and interaction pathways based on feedback from capability developers, program managers (PMs), and mission owners to ensure usability and adoption.   Deliverables may include:  - Fully functional AXIS 54 prototype system.  - Integrated AI/ML modules for initiative scoring, risk flagging, and value analysis.  - Pilot demonstrations in one or more operational environments.  - Stakeholder feedback report and performance evaluation.  - Phase III transition plan with pathways for broader DoD and commercial adoption.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III, military applications include:   - Strengthens strategic technology insertion and long-term sustainment planning across SSC portfolios.  - Institutionalizes repeatable transition pathways for SBIR/STTR efforts, Pathfinder projects, and other innovation pipelines.  - Provides Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and acquisition leaders with visibility into technology value, maturity, and risk throughout the development lifecycle.  - Enables structured evaluation and integration of non-POR capabilities that offer high operational value to the warfighter.  - Leverages AI/ML to surface emerging opportunities, flag integration risks, and support real-time, enterprise-level trade-off analysis.   Commercial applications may include:  - Highly applicable to organizations managing complex research and development (R&D) pipelines, particularly those with dual-use technology portfolios.  - Supports strategic planning and prioritization in commercial aerospace, spaceport logistics, advanced manufacturing, and defense-adjacent sectors.  - Improves communication and alignment between technical, operational, and business leadership in innovation-centric enterprises.  - Offers AI-driven portfolio analytics and insights to enhance innovation strategy, reduce investment risk, and accelerate time-to-market.   For transition pathways, the government opportunities may involve the adoption through SSC, SpaceWERX, and/or other innovation-focused DoD entities. Private sector opportunities may involve commercial deployment through SaaS or enterprise software licensing for R&D strategy, innovation portfolio management, and investment planning.   Ultimately, AXIS 54 bridges the gap between innovation and implementation—equipping both military and commercial decision-makers with a robust, AI-enabled framework to make faster, more informed decisions about which technologies to advance and how best to deploy them.

            "comprehensiveDescription": "The Department of Defense (DoD) faces a persistent challenge in transitioning promising technologies from development to operational use. This 'innovation stall' is often caused by fragmented portfolio visibility, misaligned priorities between innovators and operators, and a lack of standardized evaluation tools. Project AXIS 54 directly addresses this gap for the space domain by proposing the creation of an AI-enabled decision-support toolkit. This framework will allow cross-functional teams (capability developers, acquisition officers, program managers) to score, visualize, and prioritize technology initiatives based on criteria like operational relevance, technical maturity, and system feasibility. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) are central to this vision, intended to automate pattern recognition, identify integration risks and dependencies, and continuously refine prioritization logic from real-world data. The ultimate product is not a rigid, monolithic platform but a modular toolkit that enhances existing workflows, promotes alignment across stakeholders, and ensures the most mission-critical innovations are identified, matured, and fielded efficiently in support of USSF operations.",

This topic is offered in partnership with SpaceWERX.       This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Space Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the USSF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).       Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Space Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a Space Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.  Additional information on the USSF Commercial Space Strategy can be found at https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.      Additionally, it is possible for a solution to provide a capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if an applicant feels its solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, it can reference the “BLUE SKY” category, including an explanation of the solution’s ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of Air Force, Space Force, national, and global constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas and USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of USSF, national, and global constraints.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Space Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the USSF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Space Force need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with USSF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.       Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:    Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the Space Force need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

The program seeks proposals that can bridge the gap between a non-defense commercial solution and a validated USSF mission requirement across areas like Space Domain Awareness, SATCOM, C2, and PNT. The core requirement for applicants is to demonstrate a strong 'product-mission fit' with a specific USSF stakeholder, making pre-proposal customer discovery essential.\n\nKey capabilities needed include a mature commercial product, technical expertise for adaptation, and a clear understanding of the target USSF operational environment. The innovation potential lies not in basic research, but in the novel application and integration of commercial tech to provide disruptive new capabilities. Phase I funds a feasibility study to solidify the plan with the USSF customer, while a successful Phase II would focus on prototype development and demonstration. Collaboration is critical; proposals must show evidence of end-user engagement, and STTR applicants must partner with a research institution. Funding readiness is indicated by having a credible commercial offering and having already identified a specific USSF problem and potential customer for the proposed solution."

Traditional logistics systems struggle to integrate data from disparate sources across Army platforms and the Army is interested in enhancing their capability to rapidly handle changing situations, disruptions, and adversarial actions.  Data from logistics systems such as the Joint Battle Command Platform (JBC-P), Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-A), and SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) could be easier to understand and action if displayed in a more user-centric format. This topic should include AI technology to provide commanders with a comprehensive logistics awareness and decision-making tool that is easy to understand and accessible. The tool should have the ability to track, predict, and recommend, as defined below:    Track: Provide a real-time view of logistics assets, personnel, and supply chains. Create a Common Operating Picture (COP), which clearly depicts inventory (commodities, fuel, ammunition, etc.), vehicle status, and capabilities, while synchronizing efforts and providing commanders with accurate information. This topic will go beyond traditional analog tracking measures to increase awareness and provide real time inventory, status, and resupply requirements for operational units.     Predict: Anticipate potential disruptions, like bottlenecks and logistical shortfalls, using predictive modeling. Forecast individual unit consumption, by classes of supply, to identify problems before they become emergencies. Automatically identify and alert (with advanced notice) when planned resupply operations are insufficient, which can lead to critical shortages.     Recommend: Generate optimized COAs for routes, resupply packages, resource allocation, and risk mitigation. Automatically plan resupply routes and packages to optimize equipment and personnel utilization.    Solutions to be considered will include, but are not limited to, the following capabilities:     Ingest data from the Joint Battle Command Platform (JBCP), Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-A), and other inventory management system(s) such as SAP ERP. Awardees will have access to historical data, in the form of electronic spreadsheets, for training purposes. More details will be made available to the awardee(s). Full integration with JBCP and GCSS-A is a future endeavor but should be considered during development.     Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) compliant (see reference 3).   PORTAL Webinar:   Date: Tuesday, June 10 at 11:00AM CST   Registration Link: https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3TnciAUFTsKJonR54Dr0zw      PHASE I: This topic is accepting Direct to Phase II proposals for a cost up to $2,000,000 for an 18-month period of performance.      Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility equivalent to a Phase I project has been met. Documentation can include data, reports, specific measurements, success criteria of a prototype, etc.   (DIRECT TO) PHASE II: ​​The concept of predictive logistics tracking software has been realized in the commercial sector by multiple companies. Companies have achieved TRL 5-6. Companies have taken different approaches to creating AI-enabled logistical software, with widespread success. The DP2 SBIR will facilitate rigorous testing for selected companies and provide end user feedback for iterative improvement. ​ Refine the preliminary design proposed in the solicitation and create a prototype PORTAL software platform. Companies should work toward connecting this tool to existing military logistics systems and data sources. The final product should improve data flow while receiving and sending data into programs of record (Global Combat Support System-Army) with the aim of working to achieve an Interim Authorization to Test (IATT) and full Authority to Operate (ATO). These goals should be accomplished through training and refining developed models using real-world data and feedback from logistics personnel by leveraging the Southern Border Mission. ​​   The software should generate nuanced and contextually relevant COAs, including alternative options and risk assessments. Execute deliberate after-action reviews (AARs) after training events to iteratively evaluate recommended COAs. Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for visualizing logistics information and interacting with AI-generated recommendations. Companies should budget for quarterly travel to the supported unit conducting rigorous testing and receiving unit feedback (6 visits total over the 18-month period of performance).   For this period of performance, vendors should demonstrate the software solution on their own hardware. For example, the software solution can reside on AI/ML capable computers that the vendor brings to demonstrations or connect to vendor owned servers capable of running the software application via cloud. Companies are expected to articulate hardware and/or cloud computing requirements for future integration with Army units.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Commercial applications for logistical optimization and AI integration include but are not limited to humanitarian aid and disaster relief, supply chain management, delivery scheduling, and traffic management. The ability to analyze current logistical operations, optimize efficiency, and receive AI powered recommendations represents a key capability for commercial application.      Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief: Optimize logistics flows in challenging environments during natural disasters or humanitarian crises.     Supply Chain Management: Enhance commercial supply chain visibility, resilience, and efficiency.    Delivery Scheduling: AI-planned routes to optimize speed and fuel efficiency for shortest routes.     Traffic Management: Improve real-time traffic flow and optimize transportation routes in congested urban environments.

The call for an AI-enabled solution for 'contested environments' makes his expertise in 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)' and 'Low-power electronics' a critical differentiator, enabling the system to function with intermittent connectivity. The 'Predict' requirement (anticipating disruptions, bottlenecks) is directly addressed by his skills in 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' and predictive modeling. The 'Recommend' function, which requires AI-generated Courses of Action (COAs), will be made viable and trustworthy through his expertise in 'Explainable AI (XAI)'. Finally, his work with 'LLMs' can be leveraged to create the 'user-centric' and 'easy to understand' interface the solicitation demands, translating complex logistical data into natural language summaries for commanders.",

The SBIR program is specifically designed to bridge academic innovation and commercial/government application, a path he has successfully navigated multiple times. His $1.2M+ in funding and 7 successful proposals demonstrate a strong ability to write competitive, fundable grant applications and manage projects. This history significantly de-risks him as a principal investigator in the eyes of the funding agency.",

The primary innovation lies in creating a logistics platform that is not merely predictive, but also resilient and trustworthy. He can combine Edge AI to ensure the system operates reliably in 'contested environments', a major leap beyond cloud-dependent solutions. Integrating XAI into the COA recommendation engine would build essential commander trust, a key barrier to adoption for autonomous systems. The potential use of LLMs to create a natural language interface for commanders to query logistics status and understand recommendations would be a groundbreaking improvement in usability for military software."

This topic is offered in partnership with SpaceWERX.       This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Space Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the USSF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).       Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Space Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a Space Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.  Additional information on the USSF Commercial Space Strategy can be found at https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.      Additionally, it is possible for a solution to provide a capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if an applicant feels its solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, it can reference the “BLUE SKY” category, including an explanation of the solution’s ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of Air Force, Space Force, national, and global constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas and USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of USSF, national, and global constraints.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Space Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the USSF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Space Force need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with USSF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.       Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:    Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the Space Force need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).       Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Space Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a Space Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.  Additional information on the USSF Commercial Space Strategy can be found at https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.      Additionally, it is possible for a solution to provide a capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if an applicant feels its solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, it can reference the “BLUE SKY” category, including an explanation of the solution’s ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of Air Force, Space Force, national, and global constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas and USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of USSF, national, and global constraints.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Space Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the USSF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Space Force need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with USSF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.       Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:    Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the Space Force need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled, interactive strategy game prototype to support training and simulation for Space Logistics and Sustainment. This Phase I effort will focus on conceptualizing game mechanics, modeling realistic logistics scenarios, and developing a minimal viable simulation environment that integrates decision-support elements, human-machine interaction, and adversarial modeling. The prototype should provide a foundation for immersive training and concept of operations (CONOPS) experimentation aligned with U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment strategy.   DESCRIPTION: The USSF requires advanced training tools to prepare Guardians and logistics planners for the complex challenges of space sustainment, including adversarial interference, orbital constraints, and dynamic resupply conditions. Traditional wargaming and training platforms lack the interactivity, realism, and adaptability needed to prepare personnel for next-generation space logistics missions. Project SpaceKnight will address this gap by developing a proof-of-concept, AI-driven strategy game that simulates logistics planning and sustainment in contested space environments. This Phase I effort will focus on:   - Designing core game mechanics for both single-player and multiplayer scenarios;  - Modeling realistic constraints such as launch timing, fuel, orbital mechanics, and adversarial disruption;  - Prototyping AI-driven scenario generation to reflect real-world mission variables;  - Exploring immersive learning options using augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) and advanced human-machine interfaces;  - Demonstrating how the simulation environment can support decision-making, CONOPS exploration, and supply chain risk analysis.   The objective is to establish feasibility, validate early design elements, and lay the groundwork for a full-featured training and wargaming platform in future phases.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to establish the feasibility of SpaceKnight as an AI-enabled, game-based training and simulation tool for space logistics and sustainment. This phase will focus on conceptual design, initial prototyping, and early validation of the system's training value and operational relevance. Key activities include:   - Develop the conceptual architecture and game design, including AI logic, user interaction models, and scenario components.  - Create a functional prototype capable of simulating at least one realistic logistics or sustainment scenario, incorporating basic adversary dynamics, launch constraints, or resource limitations.  - Build an AI-driven scenario generation framework that enables dynamic mission variables and training variability.  - Conduct stakeholder interviews with USSF logistics personnel, Space Systems Command (SSC) training teams, and other relevant users to inform use cases and requirements.  - Evaluate and document how the prototype enhances decision-making, CONOPS exploration, and learning outcomes.   Deliverables may include:  - Conceptual game design and system architecture document.  - Prototype demonstration of a simulated logistics/sustainment scenario.  - Initial AI-based scenario generation engine.  - Use case study on training and decision impact.  - Stakeholder interview report and requirements validation summary.   PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to advance SpaceKnight from a Phase I prototype to a fully operational training and simulation platform for space logistics and sustainment. This phase will deliver a complete, AI-enabled game environment capable of supporting multi-user training, immersive planning, and digital decision support aligned with real-world mission variables. Key activities include:   - Develop and deploy a complete version of the SpaceKnight platform, incorporating realistic logistical and operational constraints such as fuel consumption, orbital mechanics, launch windows, and adversary behavior.  - Expand system functionality to support both turn-based and real-time scenarios in single-player and multiplayer formats, enabling distributed team exercises.  - Integrate AR/VR capabilities for enhanced immersion and scenario visualization, with support for advanced human-machine interfaces (e.g., voice, gesture, touchscreen).  - Build a robust analytics dashboard to track user performance, mission outcomes, and training metrics.  - Conduct testing in tabletop exercises (TTX) and wargaming environments to validate training efficacy and operational planning utility.  - Initiate integration with existing DoD training and learning platforms, ensuring alignment with USSF and Joint logistics frameworks.   Deliverables may include:  - Fully operational SpaceKnight simulation platform (unclassified, with capability for classified scenario extensions).  - Multi-user functionality for collaborative, distributed exercises.  - Constraint engines simulating mission realism (e.g., launch infrastructure, ground station coverage, resource availability).  - Immersive AR/VR module and interactive planning interfaces.  - Mission analytics dashboard and performance tracking tools.  - Testing and training report summarizing system effectiveness in operational exercises.  - Transition and deployment plan for DoD adoption and broader training integration.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III military applications, SpaceKnight will transition into an operational training, planning, and wargaming platform for use across SSC, USSF, and broader Joint logistics communities. Key applications include:   - Training Tool for Logistics Forces: Enhances Guardian and Airman readiness through immersive, scenario-based learning focused on contested, orbital sustainment operations.  - Strategic and Tactical Wargaming: Supports CONOPS development and mission rehearsal through dynamic adversary modeling and real-time decision environments.   Integration with Digital Twin Systems: Enables synchronization with broader planning ecosystems (e.g., VS-CDF or the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture (COP) Logistics Module) for end-to-end simulation and decision support.   For commercial applications, the underlying AI-driven simulation engine and gamified interface can be adapted for commercial use in sectors including space logistics, supply chain training, and strategic planning. Use cases include:   - Aerospace & Logistics Workforce Development: Provides high-fidelity, simulation-based training for companies managing spaceport operations, satellite logistics, or intermodal transportation.  - Space Sector Investment & Concept Testing: Serves as a strategic learning environment for commercial space startups, incubators, and venture stakeholders to test logistics models and resiliency planning.  - Academic & Defense Industry Simulation Tools: Offers customizable wargaming environments for defense contractors, think tanks, and universities conducting research on space sustainment and supply chain dynamics.

The goal is to create an immersive platform that prepares Guardians for operations in contested space environments by modeling realistic constraints like orbital mechanics, fuel, and adversarial actions. This effort addresses a critical gap where traditional training tools lack the dynamism and interactivity needed for modern space challenges. The project will progress from a Phase I feasibility study and prototype to a full-featured, multi-user AR/VR-enabled training platform in Phase II, with a clear transition path to operational use within the DoD and for dual-use commercial applications in Phase III.\n\nKey capabilities required include expertise in AI/ML (especially for dynamic scenario generation), game development, simulation and modeling, human-computer interaction, and AR/VR. A deep understanding of space logistics, orbital mechanics, and USSF operational concepts is crucial. The primary innovation lies in the fusion of these technologies to create an adaptive learning environment that moves beyond static scenarios. Success requires close collaboration with USSF end-users and stakeholders to ensure operational relevance. This ITAR-restricted opportunity is ideal for U.S. small businesses ready to tackle a high-impact national security challenge, with a clear, phased funding path from concept to operational deployment.",

            "program_focus": "This program, part of the Department of the Air Force's (DAF) AFWERX initiative, seeks to rapidly identify and adapt existing innovative commercial technologies to solve specific, identified needs within the United States Air Force (USAF). The core focus is on dual-use solutions that have a strong commercial market presence, leveraging private sector innovation for defense applications rather than funding basic research.",
            "comprehensive_description": "This is a Department of the Air Force (DAF) 'Open Topic' solicitation, run in partnership with AFWERX, designed to attract innovative, dual-use technologies from the commercial sector. The program is agnostic to specific technology domains but requires proposals to align with one of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas or justify a 'BLUE SKY' approach. The central requirement is for applicants to adapt their existing or emerging commercial solutions to meet a validated Air Force need. This necessitates that applicants have already identified a specific DAF stakeholder (end-user, program office) and can demonstrate a clear 'product-mission fit'. The program follows a phased approach: Phase I focuses on a feasibility study to validate this fit and outline an actionable plan. Successful projects may then proceed to a Phase II for prototype development, integration, and demonstration. The ultimate goal is a Phase III transition, where the adapted solution is procured by the DAF and potentially other government or commercial customers, thereby growing the defense industrial base.",
            "target_audience": "U.S.-based small businesses eligible for the SBIR/STTR program. The ideal applicant is a technology company with a commercially viable or near-market product that can be modified or adapted for a defense application.

The feasibility study should investigate all options that meet or exceed the minimum performance parameters specified in this write up.  It should address the risks and potential payoffs of the innovative technology options that are investigated and recommend the option that best achieves the objective of this technology pursuit. The funds obligated on the resulting Phase I SBIR contracts are to be used for the sole purpose of conducting a thorough feasibility study using scientific experiments and laboratory studies as necessary.  Operational prototypes will not be developed with USSOCOM SBIR funds during Phase I feasibility studies.  Operational prototypes developed with other than SBIR funds that are provided at the end of Phase I feasibility studies will not be considered in deciding what firm(s) will be selected for Phase II.      A phase II proposal is expected at the conclusion of the Phase I effort.

Additionally, Offerors will describe compliance mechanisms, offerors have in place or will put in place, to address any ITAR issues that arise during the course of agreement administration.   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this SBIR Open Topic is to develop applied research toward an innovative capability within USSOCOM Program Offices. The following are the Program Offices and their areas of interest.      DESCRIPTION:   PROGRAM OFFICE: PEO SOF Warrior, PM SOF Lethality, Visual Augmentation Systems      The technology areas of interest to PEO SOF Warrior, PM SOF Lethality are those that augment the vision of the user, known broadly as Visual Augmentation Systems (VAS). Technologies should be those that can be incorporated into a packaged size and weight fit for helmet-mounted (~8-24 oz), weapon-mounted (~8-48 oz), or handheld (~24-88 oz) form factors. The VAS program office is interested in technologies associated with the following electromagnetic spectrums: visible, near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), mid-wave infrared (MWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR).   Novel sensor and imaging technologies.    Image signal processing software to improve performance of commercial sensors including but not limited to lower noise, higher dynamic range, super resolution, and lower perceived latency. Power-efficient hardware enabling this image signal processing while reducing latency is of equal interest.    Novel, low-light, reflective band sensor technologies.   Novel emissive band sensor technologies.   Single-sensor technologies for imaging in both reflective and emissive bands.    Low-cost SWIR sensor technologies.   Passive range measurement technologies.    Passive (without emitting laser energy) fire control and augmented aim point display.   Novel display technologies to reduce size and weight of VAS devices.   Medium Range and Long Range VAS for weapon-mounted applications to increase lethality at night. There is interest in single sensor, multi-sensor, fused, or image intensified solutions.   Displays suitable for providing digital information to users wearing analog night vision goggles. There is interest in both external displays as well as displays capable of being incorporated into the housing of the night vision goggle in-line with the image intensifier.   Modular night vision goggle concepts to decrease weight while also:   increasing field of view, increasing effective depth of field, increasing situational awareness, incorporating digital displays, expanding wavelength bands beyond traditional image intensifier tubes   Low size, weight, power, and cost electronics to fuse multiple digital sensor streams & display them to the user with minimal latency.    Integration of digital solutions to enhance analog imaging systems.   Small form factor, low-cost SWIR cameras for detection of common laser rangefinders and laser markers and designators.

The feasibility study should investigate all options that meet or exceed the minimum performance parameters specified in this write up.  It should address the risks and potential payoffs of the innovative technology options that are investigated and recommend the option that best achieves the objective of this technology pursuit. The funds obligated on the resulting Phase I SBIR contracts are to be used for the sole purpose of conducting a thorough feasibility study using scientific experiments and laboratory studies as necessary.  Operational prototypes will not be developed with USSOCOM SBIR funds during Phase I feasibility studies.  Operational prototypes developed with other than SBIR funds that are provided at the end of Phase I feasibility studies will not be considered in deciding what firm(s) will be selected for Phase II.      A phase II proposal is expected at the conclusion of the Phase I effort.       PHASE II:  Develop, install, and demonstrate a prototype system determined to be the most feasible solution during the Phase I feasibility study.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  This system could be used in a broad range of military and commercial applications.       REFERENCES:   Clemenceau, P.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to develop an Autonomous Space Cargo Network (ASCN) that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven automation, autonomous robotics, and digital twin technology to modernize and optimize cargo handling and logistics operations at the Space Joint Movement Complex (SJMC) and across the Department of Defense’s (DoD) space mobility enterprise. The ASCN will improve operational efficiency, accuracy, and resilience by enabling real-time cargo visibility, autonomous load planning, and adaptive logistics execution. This capability will form the foundation for a scalable, cybersecure, and interoperable logistics framework supporting space sustainment missions in both contested and commercial environments.   DESCRIPTION: The SJMC is envisioned as the central logistics hub for DoD space operations, supporting rapid deployment, sustainment, and agile mobility. Current cargo handling and logistics processes are heavily manual, lack real-time adaptability, and are not optimized for space-based supply chains or contested logistics environments. To address these gaps, the ASCN will deliver an integrated, AI-driven logistics automation platform designed to support the SJMC and broader DoD logistics operations. The ASCN will combine autonomous robotics, intelligent decision-support, and digital twin technology to enable full-spectrum cargo management—from warehouse to orbital interface—while increasing speed, precision, and resilience. Key capabilities include:   1. Autonomous Cargo Handling & Transport Optimization – This includes robotic forklifts and cargo handlers for autonomous loading/unloading, AI-based routing, prioritization, and adaptive logistics workflows, and seamless integration with space, air, and ground mobility operations.   2. AI-Driven Logistics Command & Control – This includes real-time AI controller for cargo flow, load planning, and schedule optimization, weight-based load verification and automated resupply workflows, integration with the Spaceport of the Future’s Common Operating Picture (SPOF COP).   3. Machine Learning for Mission Adaptability – This includes predictive analytics for storage allocation and resource positioning, dynamic mission reprioritization and automated contingency planning, and visibility and orchestration across all classes of supply.   4. Commercial & Military Logistics Interoperability – This includes compatibility with U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Space Systems Command (SSC), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and commercial launch providers, joint DoD-commercial protocol development for space cargo integration, and enhanced operational readiness across government and industry supply chains.      5. Cybersecure & Resilient AI Robotics Architecture – This includes blockchain-secured logistics tracking and tamper prevention, quantum-resistant AI algorithms for autonomy assurance, and Zero Trust cybersecurity framework for secure operations at all classification levels.   This effort will lay the foundation for a future-ready, modular, and scalable space logistics infrastructure, aligned with U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment strategy and capable of supporting both terrestrial and extraterrestrial cargo networks.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to develop a conceptual design and functional prototype for the ASCN—a system that integrates AI-enabled robotics, cargo handling automation, and logistics optimization for space-focused environments. The effort will evaluate the feasibility of supporting standard DoD platforms, such as fully loaded 463L pallets, and determine the scalability of the solution for future autonomous cargo transport at the SJMC. Technical approach consideration include:   - Simulate AI-enhanced cargo workflows within the SJMC, focusing on load planning, routing, and weight distribution using real-time sensing technologies.  - Design and model robotic automation frameworks for autonomous cargo handling, scheduling, and dynamic load stabilization.  - Assess integration with existing DoD logistics platforms and commercial space operations, including compatibility with USTRANSCOM, DLA, SSC, and commercial launch provider networks.  - Conduct stakeholder engagements with logistics planners and operational units to refine system requirements.  - Execute preliminary load balance and maneuverability testing using 463L pallets to identify mechanical design needs.  - Perform energy efficiency and power requirement analyses to inform autonomous runtime and charging strategies.   Phase I deliverables include:  - Conceptual design document detailing system architecture, autonomy layers, and AI integration pathways.  - Initial prototype demonstration showcasing AI-based cargo management logic, load balancing, and sensing capabilities.  - Feasibility study covering integration potential with DoD systems, environmental resilience, scalability, and power/energy assessments.  - Phase II roadmap outlining test campaigns, system modifications for larger payloads, and milestones for operational prototype development.   PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate a fully operational prototype of the ASCN capable of autonomous cargo handling, intelligent logistics coordination, and mission adaptability in contested or austere logistics environments. This phase will validate the system’s ability to improve cargo throughput, reduce human intervention, and integrate with both DoD and commercial logistics systems. Technical focus areas include:   - Build and integrate a full-scale ASCN prototype with autonomous robotic handlers, real-time cargo identification, and secure communications.  - Implement advanced AI models for adaptive cargo prioritization, dynamic routing, and autonomous load planning.  - Integrate with existing DoD logistics platforms such as USTRANSCOM, the Spaceport of the Future’s COP Logistics Module, and commercial systems where applicable.  - Conduct operational testing in representative logistics environments (e.g., Space Launch facilities, Distribution Hubs).  - Collect performance data for load accuracy, handling speed, mission responsiveness, energy usage, and system reliability.  - Demonstrate predictive maintenance and mission adaptability functions under simulated disruption scenarios.   Phase II deliverables include:  - Fully functional ASCN prototype, including AI, autonomy, and system integration components.  - Operational test campaign report, capturing performance metrics, environmental tolerance, and logistics throughput improvements.  - AI performance evaluation, including model training, learning adaptability, and logistics decision support outputs.  - Integration documentation detailing system compatibility with SSC, DLA, USTRANSCOM, and commercial logistics platforms.  - Phase III transition plan, outlining commercialization strategy, scaling pathways, and targeted end-user adoption timelines.

This high-priority initiative aims to revolutionize space logistics by creating an integrated system of AI-driven software, autonomous robotics, and digital twin technology. The goal is to automate and optimize the entire cargo handling process—from warehouse management to orbital delivery—for the Space Joint Movement Complex (SJMC) and other strategic nodes. The ASCN must enhance operational speed, accuracy, and resilience, particularly in contested environments, while ensuring interoperability with key DoD (USTRANSCOM, SSC, DLA) and commercial logistics networks.\n\nSuccessful applicants will be small businesses with deep expertise in AI/ML, robotics, logistics automation, and cyber-resilient systems design. The project requires a phased approach, beginning with a conceptual design and feasibility study (Phase I) and progressing to a full-scale TRL 6 prototype demonstration (Phase II). The innovation potential is immense, focusing on a fully integrated, future-proof logistics framework with significant dual-use applications in commercial spaceports, aerospace manufacturing, and global supply chain management. A key funding readiness indicator is a proposal that demonstrates a holistic systems-level approach, a clear understanding of DoD operational needs, and a robust plan for technology transition and commercialization.",

Describe the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.      Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:   Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the DAF need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Computing and Software; Advanced Materials; Microelectronics      OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop open-source machine controller software and custom 3D printing toolheads that enable the fabrication and repair of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The goal is to adapt an existing 3D printer (commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or custom built) with open-source software to support PCB printing capabilities, while also developing modular toolheads optimized for conductive material printing and circuit repair. Small businesses responding to this topic should select or develop a 3D printer that supports an open-source software configuration and modify that software to meet the specific needs of PCB fabrication. Prusa’s 3D printer suite serves as an example of a COTS system that is open-source and allows for custom toolheads, but its use is not required. Companies may choose to work with any 3D printer that fits the open-source requirement or, if necessary, develop a new system. The key focus is ensuring an open, adaptable ecosystem where software and hardware work together to enable PCB printing.      DESCRIPTION: The awarded company will develop:       Open-source machine controller software modifications that enhance an existing open-source 3D printer to support PCB fabrication and repair.      Custom toolheads that enable functionalities such as conductive ink printing, pick-and-place operations, and multi-layer PCB production.       Ideally, the solution should support key functionalities, including:       Integration with a confocal scanner for substrate mapping and quality assurance.   Automated detection and repair of conductive printed traces.   Two methods of first-layer substrate detection to ensure precision.   Point-to-point manual circuit repair capability for user intervention.   Substrate alignment and automated path detection for multi-layer PCB fabrication.   CAD/CAM workflow visualization to streamline design iteration and printing processes.   The ability to project scanned height maps onto a conformal surface for accurate PCB production.   Pick-and-place component alignment that automatically adjusts to the substrate.   The ability to switch between the developed machine controller software and an OEM controller, ensuring flexibility in usage.       This solution must be built within an open-source framework, ensuring adaptability and future development. The key requirement is that the system leverages open-source software and includes custom toolheads designed for PCB manufacturing and repair.      PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.      To establish the feasibility of adapting open-source 3D printing systems for PCB fabrication and repair, the Phase I effort will focus on evaluating candidate COTS or custom-built 3D printers that support open-source machine controller software, conducting a technical assessment of integration pathways for multi-functional toolheads, and developing initial software modules to demonstrate control over basic PCB-relevant operations. Deliverables will include a technical feasibility report outlining the selected hardware platform and its suitability for modular toolhead integration, proof-of-concept demonstrations of software-driven motion control adapted for PCB deposition processes, and conceptual designs for toolheads enabling conductive ink deposition and pick-and-place functions. The Phase I work will also include preliminary software architecture documentation, risk analysis for multi-layer PCB printing integration, and an open-source compliance assessment to ensure future scalability. This foundation will validate the technical and operational viability of the proposed system and inform detailed engineering in Phase II.      PHASE II: The outcome of this STTR will be the ability to rapidly design/repair/replace obsolete components to combat obsolescence issues and meet mission objectives as well as provide custom stopgap solutions to an already fragile electronics supply chain. This effort relies heavily on machine controller software development for a specific use case.       Machine controller software exists for similar types of machines, maybe not all of the functionality that is being asked for, however, even though the software is mature, it will need to be tailored and proven to work on the AvMC inhouse machine so development work will be needed.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This technology development could be tailored to be a machine agnostic controller software able to realize the potential of many printed microelectronics machines.

          "Topic Title": "Additive Manufacturing for Circuitry",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Computing and Software; Advanced Materials; Microelectronics      OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop open-source machine controller software and custom 3D printing toolheads that enable the fabrication and repair of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The goal is to adapt an existing 3D printer (commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or custom built) with open-source software to support PCB printing capabilities, while also developing modular toolheads optimized for conductive material printing and circuit repair. Small businesses responding to this topic should select or develop a 3D printer that supports an open-source software configuration and modify that software to meet the specific needs of PCB fabrication. Prusa’s 3D printer suite serves as an example of a COTS system that is open-source and allows for custom toolheads, but its use is not required. Companies may choose to work with any 3D printer that fits the open-source requirement or, if necessary, develop a new system. The key focus is ensuring an open, adaptable ecosystem where software and hardware work together to enable PCB printing.      DESCRIPTION: The awarded company will develop:       Open-source machine controller software modifications that enhance an existing open-source 3D printer to support PCB fabrication and repair.      Custom toolheads that enable functionalities such as conductive ink printing, pick-and-place operations, and multi-layer PCB production.       Ideally, the solution should support key functionalities, including:       Integration with a confocal scanner for substrate mapping and quality assurance.   Automated detection and repair of conductive printed traces.   Two methods of first-layer substrate detection to ensure precision.   Point-to-point manual circuit repair capability for user intervention.   Substrate alignment and automated path detection for multi-layer PCB fabrication.   CAD/CAM workflow visualization to streamline design iteration and printing processes.   The ability to project scanned height maps onto a conformal surface for accurate PCB production.   Pick-and-place component alignment that automatically adjusts to the substrate.   The ability to switch between the developed machine controller software and an OEM controller, ensuring flexibility in usage.       This solution must be built within an open-source framework, ensuring adaptability and future development. The key requirement is that the system leverages open-source software and includes custom toolheads designed for PCB manufacturing and repair.      PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.      To establish the feasibility of adapting open-source 3D printing systems for PCB fabrication and repair, the Phase I effort will focus on evaluating candidate COTS or custom-built 3D printers that support open-source machine controller software, conducting a technical assessment of integration pathways for multi-functional toolheads, and developing initial software modules to demonstrate control over basic PCB-relevant operations. Deliverables will include a technical feasibility report outlining the selected hardware platform and its suitability for modular toolhead integration, proof-of-concept demonstrations of software-driven motion control adapted for PCB deposition processes, and conceptual designs for toolheads enabling conductive ink deposition and pick-and-place functions. The Phase I work will also include preliminary software architecture documentation, risk analysis for multi-layer PCB printing integration, and an open-source compliance assessment to ensure future scalability. This foundation will validate the technical and operational viability of the proposed system and inform detailed engineering in Phase II.      PHASE II: The outcome of this STTR will be the ability to rapidly design/repair/replace obsolete components to combat obsolescence issues and meet mission objectives as well as provide custom stopgap solutions to an already fragile electronics supply chain. This effort relies heavily on machine controller software development for a specific use case.       Machine controller software exists for similar types of machines, maybe not all of the functionality that is being asked for, however, even though the software is mature, it will need to be tailored and proven to work on the AvMC inhouse machine so development work will be needed.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This technology development could be tailored to be a machine agnostic controller software able to realize the potential of many printed microelectronics machines.

          "synopsis": "The goal of this solicitation is to encourage small businesses to propose “out of the box” ideas to demonstrate “proof of concept” for the development of innovative technologies to make a transformative impact in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care of pediatric or rare cancer patients. To be considered innovative, projects must have the potential to transform the way research is conducted through the development of novel tools or technologies or lead to major improvements in pediatric and rare cancer care through the development of highly innovative therapies, diagnostic tools, or preventive strategies. Projects that primarily focus on optimization, hardening, or obvious extrapolations of established technology might be less competitive. For example, the following types of projects would not be considered innovative and would not be responsive: • Therapeutics targeting genes and pathways with FDA-approved agents or agents in late clinical stage unless the novel approach mitigates known issues with approved agents • Screening, diagnostic, and monitoring approaches already in clinical use • Continuation of already funded SBIR/STTR projects Proposals are encouraged for the development of innovative approaches focused on detection, prevention, and treatment of pediatric or rare cancers. The solicitation is agnostic to the type of technologies and modalities as long as they are highly innovative and reflect ideas substantially improved from current state of the art. Projects supported by this program should not be low risk, or incremental improvements to established technologies. These could include but not limited to novel therapeutics and prevention approaches, therapeutic devices, drug delivery approaches, and devices focused on early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response. Proposals are solicited for all innovative ideas – not limited to the ones above – if they are focused on detection, prevention, and treatment of pediatric cancers or rare cancers. Projects are anticipated to have a high risk of failure with concomitant high reward. Commercial potential is evaluated by assuming the continued development of technology is successful, regardless of the inherent risk of the project. The awards will support initial exploration of untested but potentially transformative ideas that may radically change the way we understand, prevent, diagnose, treat, and manage rare or pediatric cancers. These Concept Awards are intended to provide funds to perform key de-risking activities to demonstrate proof-of-concept and feasibility and lay the groundwork for future Federal funding opportunities. Concept awards are not intended to support continuation of already established and advanced research programs. Thus, preliminary data is not required; however, the ideas should have sound scientific premise either based on the offeror’s own research or literature evidence. These awards are focused on development of innovative products and technologies; thus, the anticipated product that will be developed should be identified and a development path should be clearly laid out. In addition to funds provided to demonstrate technical proof-of-concept, the program will integrate customer discovery and entrepreneurial training to ensure that awardees develop an appropriate business model, market fit, and commercialization plan. As such, the awardees are expected to go through the NIH I-CorpsTM (see section 2.3) program. Concept Awardees will also receive entrepreneurial mentorship to help them refine their business model and commercialization plan. Activities and deliverables proposed by the offerors would differ based on their technology types and stage of development. However, the offerors should ensure that they clearly identify the clinical problem and cancer type(s) that the proposal will focus on with adequate justification. In addition, the offerors should propose experiments to obtain initial de-risking and proof-of-concept data and at the completion of the project present a report with the results of the experiments to the NCI. Examples of activities and deliverables that could be proposed include (but are not limited to) the following: Device Development Projects: The offeror could propose most or all of these activities for pediatric or rare cancers. • Evaluation and justification of clinical need • Product concept and protype development • Early feasibility studies • Phantom validation • In vivo validation studies • Software development (if needed) • Biocompatibility, sterility, and safety studies Diagnostics Development Projects: The offeror could propose most or all of these activities for pediatric or rare cancers. • Biomarker optimization and qualification • Assay development and optimization • Define assay performance and analytic validation • Sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility • Validation studies in deidentified clinical samples",

The core goal is to support 'proof-of-concept' and feasibility studies for untested but potentially transformative concepts. The program explicitly discourages projects that are low-risk, incremental, or represent obvious extrapolations of existing technologies. For instance, therapeutics targeting well-established pathways without a novel approach or diagnostics already in clinical use are considered non-responsive. Preliminary data is not a requirement; however, proposals must be built upon a sound scientific premise from literature or foundational research. A key component of this award is mandatory participation in the NIH I-Corps™ program, which provides entrepreneurial training and mentorship to help awardees validate their business model and commercialization strategy through customer discovery.

The program seeks to fund 'proof-of-concept' studies for truly transformative and 'out of the box' ideas in therapeutics, devices, diagnostics, or digital health. Unlike standard SBIRs, preliminary data is not required, but proposals must present a strong, literature-based scientific premise for their novel approach. The focus is on de-risking activities to establish feasibility, with the goal of achieving TRL 3-4.\n\nKey capabilities needed include deep technical expertise in the proposed domain (e.g., bioengineering, assay development) and a clear vision for a future product. The core expectation is radical innovation that could fundamentally change cancer research or care, not incremental improvements. The program has a strong commercialization focus, with mandatory awardee participation in the NIH I-Corps™ program for customer discovery and business model development. This opportunity is ideal for early-stage companies with groundbreaking but unproven concepts that are too risky for conventional funding mechanisms. Success requires embracing the high-risk nature of the project while providing a credible plan to validate the core concept."

These skills can be directly applied to create novel solutions: XAI for interpretable diagnostic support from medical images or genomic data; Edge AI and wearables for low-power, continuous patient monitoring devices; and LLMs for advanced digital health tools for patient care and symptom tracking. This is a direct match for developing the 'novel tools' and 'devices' requested.",

The proposal must not be about discovering new biology but about creating transformative technological tools for clinicians and patients, which is precisely the researcher's strength.",

As a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with multiple successful NSF SBIR grants (e.g., 'NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf'), he has demonstrated mastery of the specific funding mechanism, including its emphasis on commercialization and innovation. His unsuccessful attempts at NIH funding in the cancer space ('Trialia_NIH_NCI...', 'NIH SBIR Phase 1 proposal (AD).pdf') are also valuable, providing lessons learned and a foundation of domain knowledge to build upon for this NSF-focused application.",

Applying cutting-edge techniques like XAI, federated learning, or LLMs to the data-scarce and highly specialized field of pediatric and rare cancers is inherently innovative and transformative. A project combining his expertise in Edge AI and anomaly detection to create a wearable for early relapse detection in pediatric leukemia patients would be a prime example of the high-risk, high-reward, 'out of the box' concept this solicitation explicitly encourages, moving far beyond 'incremental improvements'."

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Computing and Software; Trusted AI   and Autonomy      The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE:   The proposed topic describes an effort to develop and demonstrate cognitive mapping algorithms that leverage knowledge of architectural patterns to produce 2D or 3D maps of building interiors. Integrate the solution into the modular, open mapping architecture developed by the Defense Threat Reduction   Agency’s (DTRA) Mapping and Awareness for CWMD Operations (MACO) program.      DESCRIPTION:    Charged with supporting operations for countering weapons of mass destruction, DTRA leads a broad range of R&D programs that support the Services, SOCOM, and other DoD stakeholders. DTRA research includes technologies such as MACO, which is developed to support missions conducted in underground facilities and other GPS-denied environments.      Conventional SLAM involves using data-heavy point clouds to create a map of the surrounding environment; however, there is much that can be inferred from the architectural details of a structure that is omitted in SLAM-based map construction methods. For instance, long hallways that challenge conventional Light Distance and Ranging (LiDAR) SLAM systems could be refined with the inference that architecturally, most hallways remain a straight, parallel line structure in the map. As the SLAM drifts, the straight, parallel wall assumption would serve to correct that drift by parallelizing the walls.   Similarly, a cognitive mapping system seeing partially into two side-by-side rooms and viewing only part of the shared wall between them could infer that the wall extends the entire length between the two rooms; it may note a grid of columns and infer that distant columns have the same spacing; and it may infer that a stairwell extends from the observed floor up to the highest known floor. By integrating architectural knowledge and design pattern recognition in these ways, this project will enhance the capabilities of traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques.      Through cognitive mapping, solutions will be able to make informed predictions about the environment, even in the presence of incomplete or noisy sensor data. This will enable the creation of more accurate and robust maps, particularly in feature-poor environments like long, smooth hallways or areas with limited visual features. Maps will also carry more information embedded in them, allowing users and autonomous systems to understand the environment, its hazards, and how best to traverse through it without having to interpret direct renderings of sensor data.      Approaches may utilize machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize and infer architectural features and patterns, such as hallway parallelism, shared walls, symmetry in room layouts, staircase & elevator placement, column & beam spacings, and other common design elements. Prototypes may leverage conventional SLAM algorithms and sensors to generate a baseline map, then process it further to incorporate architectural understandings. Maps generated by prototype systems may be 2D or 3D, and may range from whiteboard sketch to architectural blueprint; in any case, they must provide more value than existing SLAM methods by enabling DTRA end users to execute counter-WMD missions in GPS-denied spaces with greater situational awareness. Solutions will be assessed during regular and ongoing mapping experiments and exercises conducted by DTRA and its partners as part of the MACO   program.      PHASE I:    Phase I of this project is data-gathering, processing, and model creation. Activities and deliverables may   include:   Collection of data sets and identification of existing labeled datasets      Annotate and label data with architectural known qualities      Select and implement machine learning methodology and begin training a prototype model      Model optimization and tuning for enhanced spatial reasoning      Deploy simple model for MACO integration and validation         PHASE II:    Phase II expected activities and deliverables include:      Advanced model development, expansion of datasets, and real-time SLAM inference      Testing, assessment, and training of model in varying conditions      Optimize models for NVIDIA compact compute      Create User Interface and/or visualization that integrates architectural insights with truth SLAM map data      Delivery of stable binary, licensing, and documentation      Delivery of a Phase III transition plan, and Technology roadmap outline         PHASE III:     Phase III develops and produces fieldable prototypes using accepted systems engineering practices to ensure satisfaction of functional requirements and proper management of system configuration. Enable preliminary usage by DoD customers, including DTRA RD-CX and counter-WMD stakeholders. Develop configurations for other DoD systems requiring architecture-aware mapping. Although additional funding may be provided through DoD sources, the awardee should look to other public or private sector funding sources for assistance with transition and commercialization. There is high dual-use potential for this technology that apply to mapping and autonomy in the commercial sector. For example, this technology may be used by commercial robots to perceive their environments or by construction, building   maintenance, and real estate companies to document building layouts and as-built conditions.

His skills in 'Computer Vision in Manufacturing' involve spatial analysis and pattern recognition analogous to identifying walls, hallways, and rooms. Furthermore, his deep knowledge of 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)' and 'Low-power electronics' is critical for deploying these algorithms on platforms operating in GPS-denied, resource-constrained environments, as required by the MACO program.",

This demonstrates a strong grasp of the SBIR program's structure, which values technology commercialization alongside innovation. While this is a DoD SBIR, the core principles are similar, giving him a significant advantage over applicants new to the SBIR/STTR framework.

Dr. Costilla Reyes can propose a novel hybrid architecture. This system would use a standard SLAM algorithm for initial point cloud generation, but its key innovation would be a parallel XAI-driven 'Architectural Sanity Engine.' This engine, trained on architectural patterns, would actively correct, refine, and infer map details (e.g., straightening long hallways, completing occluded room corners), directly addressing the solicitation's core objective. This approach perfectly embodies the 'Trusted AI' concept by making the mapping process more robust and explainable."

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI & Autonomy   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an underwater sensor optimized for size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) that can be mounted on a small uncrewed boat to detect bathymetry and underwater hazards in shallow, bubbly environments.​   DESCRIPTION: There is an increasing need to enable U.S. Army sustainment and maneuver support operations through littoral environments, including shallow-water and surfzone based landings, in potentially contested regions. In particular, enabling maritime operations and autonomous distribution to support logistics over the shore for the Joint Forces was recently identified as an S&T priority. In these over-the-shore operations, mapping bathymetry and shallow water hazards (e.g., unexploded ordinance) are of primary importance to ensure safe, efficient, and effective force projection. On exposed coasts, bubbles from breaking waves are a typical environmental impediment that attenuate acoustic signals denying adequate sensing, which leaves crewed or uncrewed systems with limited situational awareness in a particularly challenging environment, arguably the most critical portion of any transit.​   Surfzone bubbles range in sizes, depending on whether they are part of the alpha plume (initial injection) with sizes ranging from cm to tens of micros or the gamma plume (resident plume of smaller bubbles), the both of which creates attenuation of acoustic signals (Deane G. B., 1997, 1999). Leighton (2010) highlighted methods to classify bubbles and reduce their clutter using a Twin Inverted Pair Sonar (TWIPS) signal, motivated by signals used by dolphins. This was examined in boat wakes by Leighton (2011). Lee (2016) highlights bubble’s non-linear response as a potential method for discerning bubbles from hard targets. Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least). Geometries should consider usage mounting on small uncrewed surface vehicles.   Deliver a reporting document: (1) a computer-aided design (CAD) model of developed technology(s) (2) the experimental procedures and results that demonstrate the process meets the performance requirements; (3) the developed system. A favorable performance evaluation will lead into Phase III applications. All research, development, and prototype designs shall be documented with detailed descriptions and specifications of the composition, fabrication, microstructure, and mechanical performance of the prototype repair materials.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a strong commercial hydrographic survey industry that could benefit from this technology. Hydrographic surveys are required as part of every USACE Civil Works beach and navigation project nationally, and are used widely within the commercial dredging industry and maritime safety industries.  Presently, operation in the surf-zone is constrained to low or non-breaking wave conditions, meaning the ability to collect these data are significantly weather-constrained.         REFERENCES:    https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/102/5/2671/558076/Sound-generation-and-air-entrainment-by-breaking   https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/29/7/1520-0485_1999_029_1393_aepabs_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display   https://pubs.aip.org/as       KEYWORDS: Surf Zone; Autonomy; Landing; Acoustics; Bubbles; Sensing; Underwater Sensing; Acoustic Sensors",

The primary goal is to overcome the challenge of acoustic signal attenuation caused by bubbles in high-energy surf zones.

A primary obstacle is the inability of standard acoustic sensors to function effectively in the surf zone, where breaking waves generate dense bubble plumes that attenuate and scatter signals. This topic solicits innovative solutions to sense the seafloor and submerged hazards through these bubbly conditions. The desired outcome is a rugged, portable, and SWAP-C (Size, Weight, Power, and Cost) optimized sensor that can be mounted on small Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). The system must provide real-time data for navigation, with a minimum detection range as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. The program follows a phased development approach: Phase I focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of a single-beam concept in a laboratory environment. Phase II will involve manufacturing a field-ready prototype (ideally progressing to multi-beam or side-scan capabilities) and demonstrating its effectiveness in a relevant surf zone environment.

The primary technical hurdle is overcoming severe acoustic signal attenuation caused by bubble plumes from breaking waves, a problem that renders current sensors ineffective. This capability is critical for U.S. Army logistics-over-the-shore (LOTS) and autonomous maneuver support in contested littoral environments. The program requires the development of a ruggedized system capable of real-time processing to support autonomous navigation. The project follows a phased approach, starting with a 6-month, $250k Phase I for a laboratory proof-of-concept, followed by a larger Phase II for field prototype development and demonstration. A key innovation is expected in signal processing or sensor modality, moving beyond conventional sonar. The topic strongly emphasizes dual-use potential, targeting the commercial hydrographic survey industry, which faces similar operational constraints. The government has indicated potential support for field testing, offering a valuable partnership opportunity. A successful proposal must demonstrate a novel technical approach, a strong team with expertise in acoustics and rugged hardware, and a clear strategy for both military transition and commercial success.",

The goal is to adapt an existing 3D printer (commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or custom built) with open-source software to support PCB printing capabilities, while also developing modular toolheads optimized for conductive material printing and circuit repair. Small businesses responding to this topic should select or develop a 3D printer that supports an open-source software configuration and modify that software to meet the specific needs of PCB fabrication. Prusa’s 3D printer suite serves as an example of a COTS system that is open-source and allows for custom toolheads, but its use is not required. Companies may choose to work with any 3D printer that fits the open-source requirement or, if necessary, develop a new system. The key focus is ensuring an open, adaptable ecosystem where software and hardware work together to enable PCB printing.      DESCRIPTION: The awarded company will develop:       Open-source machine controller software modifications that enhance an existing open-source 3D printer to support PCB fabrication and repair.      Custom toolheads that enable functionalities such as conductive ink printing, pick-and-place operations, and multi-layer PCB production.       Ideally, the solution should support key functionalities, including:       Integration with a confocal scanner for substrate mapping and quality assurance.   Automated detection and repair of conductive printed traces.   Two methods of first-layer substrate detection to ensure precision.   Point-to-point manual circuit repair capability for user intervention.   Substrate alignment and automated path detection for multi-layer PCB fabrication.   CAD/CAM workflow visualization to streamline design iteration and printing processes.   The ability to project scanned height maps onto a conformal surface for accurate PCB production.   Pick-and-place component alignment that automatically adjusts to the substrate.   The ability to switch between the developed machine controller software and an OEM controller, ensuring flexibility in usage.       This solution must be built within an open-source framework, ensuring adaptability and future development. The key requirement is that the system leverages open-source software and includes custom toolheads designed for PCB manufacturing and repair.      PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.      To establish the feasibility of adapting open-source 3D printing systems for PCB fabrication and repair, the Phase I effort will focus on evaluating candidate COTS or custom-built 3D printers that support open-source machine controller software, conducting a technical assessment of integration pathways for multi-functional toolheads, and developing initial software modules to demonstrate control over basic PCB-relevant operations. Deliverables will include a technical feasibility report outlining the selected hardware platform and its suitability for modular toolhead integration, proof-of-concept demonstrations of software-driven motion control adapted for PCB deposition processes, and conceptual designs for toolheads enabling conductive ink deposition and pick-and-place functions. The Phase I work will also include preliminary software architecture documentation, risk analysis for multi-layer PCB printing integration, and an open-source compliance assessment to ensure future scalability. This foundation will validate the technical and operational viability of the proposed system and inform detailed engineering in Phase II.      PHASE II: The outcome of this SBIR will be the ability to rapidly design/repair/replace obsolete components to combat obsolescence issues and meet mission objectives as well as provide custom stopgap solutions to an already fragile electronics supply chain. This effort relies heavily on machine controller software development for a specific use case.       Machine controller software exists for similar types of machines, maybe not all of the functionality that is being asked for, however, even though the software is mature, it will need to be tailored and proven to work on the AvMC inhouse machine so development work will be needed.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This technology development could be tailored to be a machine agnostic controller software able to realize the potential of many printed microelectronics machines.

This foundation will validate the technical and operational viability of the proposed system and inform detailed engineering in Phase II.      PHASE II: The outcome of this SBIR will be the ability to rapidly design/repair/replace obsolete components to combat obsolescence issues and meet mission objectives as well as provide custom stopgap solutions to an already fragile electronics supply chain. This effort relies heavily on machine controller software development for a specific use case.       Machine controller software exists for similar types of machines, maybe not all of the functionality that is being asked for, however, even though the software is mature, it will need to be tailored and proven to work on the AvMC inhouse machine so development work will be needed.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This technology development could be tailored to be a machine agnostic controller software able to realize the potential of many printed microelectronics machines.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Integrated Sensing and Cyber      The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE:    DTRA seeks to develop and demonstrate a lightweight, droppable chemical warfare agent sensor capable   of real-time detection, identification, and geolocation of chemical threats.      DESCRIPTION:    CBRN Technical Forces employ the Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) to provide individual CWA detection and alerting in real-time during operations in potentially contaminated environments. However, given the JCAD’s weight, power, and lack of native mesh networking capability, it is not an optimal sensor to employ from individuals or uncrewed systems [1]. The droppable chemical agent detection sensor is an ultra-compact, low SWaP, device designed to provide real-time detection, identification, and mapping of chemical warfare agents and VOC’s in operational environments. Engineered for deployment by aerial or ground uncrewed vehicles and individual personnel, the sensors provide rapid hazard awareness for technical forces. Once deployed, each sensor continuously monitors the environment, autonomously analyzing air samples and providing immediate detection alerts. Upon detection, the sensor generates geolocated data, automatically pushing its detection results and environmental metadata into ATAK.      Through embedded wireless mesh networking capability, the sensors create a resilient, scalable, detection grid, allowing the information or real-time hazard maps that update dynamically as threat presence change. Data is transmitted using Cursor-On-Target messages, enabling seamless interoperability with ATAK clients, WebTAK, WinTAK, and TAK servers. Sensor status, detection, and locations are visualized directly on the ATAK map, allowing users to rapidly assess affected areas and informing operational decisions.      Requirements for this development are as follows:      Drop Sensor SWaP:      Utilizes Nanopore Technology 512 Channel MinION Flow Cell      <2.5” diameter, <1” height      Weight = <2.5 oz.      Scalable employment options for UAS employment      Capable of identifying a range of CWA and TIC; response time < 5 minutes      48-hour battery life, extendable sleep mode option      Geolocated outputs; each detection tagged with GPS coordinates      Mesh Networking; multiple sensors interconnect to expand coverage and maintain communication in denied communications environments      Integration into the ATAK CBRNPI utilizing ProtoBuff programming language partnered with a DTRA-approved ATAK CBRNPI Developer      Drop-tested to MIL-STD-810G for ruggedization         PHASE I:    Candidate chemical detection technologies (e.g., miniaturized IMS, colorimetric arrays, electrochemical sensors) will be evaluated and down-selected based on sensitivity, size, and power considerations. Bench- top testing against chemical simulants will be conducted to validate early performance. Sensor modules will be designed, integrating detection elements, GPS geolocation, a mesh networking architecture, and initial COT messaging capabilities for ATAK integration. Networking feasibility will be demonstrated through a mesh network of multiple units, with CoT message transmission to a TAK client. Additionally, an initial hazard mapping concept will be developed to model threat zones. Phase I will conclude with a feasibility report, a detailed prototype design package, and a refined Phase II development plan.      PHASE II:    Field and demonstrate fully functional, ruggedized drop sensor prototypes. Focus on integrating advanced detection technologies with a compact, MIL-STD-810G-certified enclosure, achieving long operational life (>72hours) on battery power. Chemical sensing capabilities will be expanded to cover CWAs with improved detection thresholds, validated through laboratory and live agent testing. Mesh networking capabilities will be enhanced with self-forming, self-healing protocols, supporting both peer-to-peer communications and data relay to TAK clients or servers via PyTAK. Hazard field interpolation algorithms will be finalized and implemented into custom ATAK visualization layers for real-time hazard mapping, complete with gradient concentration displays. Multiple prototypes will be fabricated and   deployed in operationally relevant condition, supporting a full range of DoD CBRN missions.       PHASE III:    This phase will further develop the capability developed in Phase II by improving robustness and user application. Although additional funding may be provided through DoD sources, the awardee should look to other public or private sector funding sources for assistance with transition and   commercialization.

The objective is to create a lightweight, low-power, droppable sensor network to provide real-time CWA/TIC detection and situational awareness for military forces, replacing the cumbersome JCAD system. The core technical challenge is to engineer an ultra-compact (<2.5 oz, <2.5\" diameter) sensor based on Nanopore Technology (512 Channel MinION Flow Cell). Key requirements include a <5 minute response time, 48-72 hour battery life, MIL-STD-810G ruggedization, and native mesh-networking capabilities. A critical requirement is seamless integration into the Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK) ecosystem, using ProtoBuff and Cursor-on-Target messaging to generate dynamic, geolocated hazard maps. The project is divided into a Phase I feasibility study and a Phase II prototype demonstration, including live agent testing.",

A mandatory requirement is a partnership with a DTRA-approved ATAK CBRNPI developer.",
            "innovation_and_impact": "The innovation lies in creating the first-of-its-kind networked, droppable nanopore-based CWA sensor grid. Success will dramatically enhance warfighter safety and operational effectiveness by providing real-time, standoff chemical threat mapping capabilities deployable from uncrewed systems or by individuals. The technology has significant transition potential to DoD programs of record and other government agencies.",
            "collaboration": "A confirmed partnership with a DTRA-approved ATAK developer is essential for a successful proposal. Collaboration with DoD testing facilities will be required in Phase II. The project is governed by ITAR/EAR, restricting international collaboration.",

His skills in Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI), low-power electronics, and IoT are a direct fit for creating an 'ultra-compact, low SWaP, device' that 'autonomously analyz[es] air samples'. The core task of detecting chemical agents is an anomaly/outlier detection problem, another area of his expertise. He can effectively design the 'brains' of the sensor: the processing unit, the power management system, and the intelligent algorithms for detection. However, there is a significant gap in the physical/chemical sensing modality itself (e.g., spectroscopy, electrochemistry). Success is contingent on addressing this gap.",

His experience with the SBIR program, even if with NSF, is highly relevant as he understands the phased approach, commercialization requirements, and proposal structure. His entrepreneurial background is a significant asset for the DoD's goal of transitioning technology to the warfighter (Phase III). The primary experiential gap is the lack of direct DoD contracting and ITAR/EAR compliance history, which will be a learning curve.",

His expertise in Edge AI and anomaly detection can lead to a sensor with higher accuracy and a lower false alarm rate than existing solutions. The most compelling innovation potential lies in his expertise with 'Energy Harvesting Systems for IoT.' Proposing a self-powered or ultra-long-life sensor through energy harvesting would be a game-changing differentiator, directly addressing the operational challenges of deploying a sensor grid. Furthermore, his background in Explainable AI (XAI) could be leveraged to provide confidence metrics with detections, increasing user trust."

          "synopsis": "Background  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with their mission to improve health and save lives.  As described by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the statutory purpose of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is to strengthen the role of innovative small business concerns (SBCs) in federally-funded research or research and development. The purpose of the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program is to stimulate a partnership of ideas and technologies between innovative SBCs and non-profit Research Institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their extramural research budget to the SBIR program, and those with extramural research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside an additional 0.45% to the STTR program.  Purpose  This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II, Direct to Phase II (NIH Only), Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase IIB (NIH only) grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PA-24-247 or PAR-24-248.  SBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.  NIH Fast-Track: An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  NIH Direct to Phase II: For small businesses that have already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but have not received a Phase I SBIR or STTR for that project, NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award. The NIH will accept Direct to Phase II applications regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Direct to Phase II awards should be submitted as “New” applications and not continuations (\"Renewal\") of Phase I SBIR or STTR projects.  NIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR or STTR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed Phase IIB project. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants must provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors. NIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR NOFOs or other specific NOFOs, are listed in the current SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. Additional requirements and instructions (e.g., submission of a letter of intent) are available in the specific IC research topics section and in the NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities that allow Phase IIB applications.  Specific Objectives  The SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA represent scientific program areas that may be of interest to applicant small businesses in the development of projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise to contribute to the R&D mission(s) of the NIH, CDC, or FDA awarding components identified in this NOFO are encouraged to submit SBIR grant applications in these areas. SBIR grant applications will also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the Components of Participating Organizations listed for this NOFO. In addition to the general SBIR solicitations, some awarding components have additional, specific NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities of potential interest to small businesses.  Applicants are not required to identify a potential awarding component prior to submission of the application but may request one on the Assignment Request Form. Staff within the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point for all NIH, CDC, and FDA grant applications, will assign all applications to the most appropriate Agency and Institute/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science proposed. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices website.  All applications submitted to this Parent Notice of Funding Opportunity are not allowed to propose clinical trial(s).

Sponsored by the NIH, CDC, and FDA, it supports investigator-initiated R&D across a vast spectrum of public health and biomedical domains. The program uses a phased approach: Phase I (R43) for feasibility and proof-of-concept, and Phase II (R44) for prototype development and pre-commercialization. NIH also offers accelerated pathways like Fast-Track and Direct-to-Phase II for qualifying projects. Key technologies of interest include pre-clinical therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices, research tools, and health IT solutions that address significant unmet needs.\n\nSuccessful applicants must demonstrate both high technical innovation and strong commercial potential. A credible, well-researched commercialization plan is as critical as the scientific merit of the proposal. Expertise is needed in the relevant scientific/engineering discipline, coupled with business acumen for market strategy, intellectual property, and regulatory planning. While formal partnerships are not required, collaborations with research institutions (via subcontracts) and evidence of future commercial or investor interest (via letters of support) are highly valued. This opportunity is ideal for early-stage companies with a novel technology, a clear understanding of its market, and the capability to execute a rigorous R&D plan. Applications are accepted on standard, recurring deadlines throughout the year.",

          "synopsis": "Recommendations and milestones for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) research from the National Alzheimer’s Project Act and, the 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2021 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summits present a wide range of research and development proposals which, if pursued, have the potential to reduce the human burden and healthcare costs associated with AD/ADRD.    As part of the National Institute on Aging's (NIA) strategic plan to support the development of innovative strategies and therapies to prevent, diagnose, and treat AD/ADRD, this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications to NIA's Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. The aim of this FOA is to encourage research on, and the commercialization of, novel therapies, devices, products, and healthcare programs and practices to prevent the onset of AD/ADRD, and to reduce the burden that AD/ADRD places on individuals, their families, and society at large.    Examples of research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:    Prevention:    Behavioral, environmental, pharmacological, and nutritional interventions to prevent and/or remediate brain biochemical and/or neurophysiological changes caused by neurodegenerative diseases, including age-related sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or age-related decrements in balance and postural control, gait performance, and mobility.  Programs to support cognitive training to improve cognitive function in the elderly. Examples of topics appropriate for such programs include, but are not limited to, the following:  Rapid development of novel, engaging, computer-based cognitive-training programs based on empirically-established approaches using cognitive training to target a specific neural system/functional domain;  Augmentation of existing computerized cognitive interventions that can be individually tailored to engage, adapt, challenge, and optimize functional cognitive abilities to enhance cognitive functioning and performance of activities of daily living; and  Development of interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline, especially using technology platforms with wide acceptance among older adults.  Diagnosis:    Sensitive, specific, and standardized tests for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, including the development of new, cost-effective, minimally-invasive biomarkers that could be used for screening in the general population and in community settings. In addition, this FOA encourages research that would identify new biomarkers that could serve as surrogate measures for disease progression in AD/ADRD. Other advances might include the development of new instrumentation, imaging technology, related devices, and software packages for use in visualizing neural activity during cognitive, emotional, motor, or sensory behavior in older adults.  Biosensors and prosthetic devices, technologies, and related software development to aid in the assessment, diagnosis, and remediation of age-related cognitive decline.  Machine-learning tools and cognitive batteries that can be integrated into Electronic Medical Records (EMR) for diagnosis of MCI and AD/ADRD.  New approaches for the assessment of persons living with multiple chronic conditions in clinical practice, including development and validation of brief cognitive-screening measures.  Treatment:    Discovery, development, and/or evaluation of drugs and/or biological or natural products, including central nervous system delivery systems, to remediate age-related cognitive decline and treat the cognitive impairment and/or behavioral symptoms associated with MCI, AD/ADRD, and other dementias of aging. In addition, this FOA invites research on therapies that might slow and/or reverse the course of AD/ADRD or prevent them entirely through the application of systems-biology and systems-pharmacology approaches. Therapeutics addressing novel targets are of particular interest.  Clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of drug, nutritional, behavioral, cognitive, or other types of interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline and treat cognitive impairment and/or behavioral symptoms associated with MCI, AD/ADRD, and other dementias of aging, as well as to slow and/or reverse the course of AD/ADRD or to prevent their onset.  Care:    New technologies for in-home use or for coordination or delivery of services to sustain in-home living for individuals living with MCI or AD/ADRD. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:  Systems and devices to evaluate, monitor, improve, or adapt to changes in cognition;  Improvements in health-service delivery;  Improvements in the preservation of functional independence;  Technologies supporting independent living and the conduct of everyday tasks at home;  Provision of information to healthcare providers and family members enabling assessment of patient needs and/or intervention(s); and  Promotion of effective communication and interaction between individuals living with dementia in the community or in institutional settings and their healthcare providers, friends, and family members.  Assistive robotics technology that can support a person in order to maintain or improve their independence, safety, and well-being when diagnosed with AD/ADRD and alleviate the burden of care. Such efforts might include the development of socially-assistive robots that can support engagement, social participation, and leisure activities of patients living with MCI and AD/ADRD.  Cost-effective technology to create dementia-friendly cities and environments for individuals diagnosed with AD/ADRD. This might include the development of alarm technology and tracking and location-monitoring devices to alert caregivers and others of the whereabouts of individuals living with AD/ADRD. Other advances might include innovative research to develop safer home environments, such as automatic shut-off valves for water (e.g. a sink could overflow when one forgets to turn off faucet) and electricity and gas (e.g. forgetting to turn off stove).  Comprehensive telecare systems that can be used to support independence and personal safety of an individual living with AD/ADRD and other dementias. Such telecare systems might include community alarms, medication reminders, sensors for floods or extreme temperatures, detection of absence from normal activities (e.g. sitting in a chair, going to bed), fall detection, and unobtrusive sensors to monitor activities of daily living and vital signs that can be reported to a healthcare provider. Other advances might include the development of technology that would allow for in-place monitoring of individuals at all stages of AD/ADRD. Ideally, such information would be integrated with other patient-relevant data in EMR.  Wearable, mobile, or other technology to enable direct, objective, and continuous data capture of everyday functions in individuals living with AD/ADRD.  Recent reviews of relevant scientific literature revealed the presence of disparities of care between diverse racial and ethnic minority populations of individuals with AD/ADRD. To address such disparities, this FOA encourages research to develop educational training programs for physicians, nursing assistants, home-care aids, and long-term-care services. These programs would focus on training healthcare staff to provide culturally-appropriate care to the patient at the right time and in the right setting.  Tools:    Novel technologies to monitor, assist, or maintain daily functioning of older individuals living with AD/ADRD and other cognitive impairments.  Manuals and training materials for existing evidence-based interventions that reduce the burden of caregiving for AD/ADRD caregivers which can be used by community-based agencies and/or healthcare organizations.  A tool that could be sold to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to allow them to accurately project future costs of caring for patients living with AD/ADRD and other forms of dementia. Such a tool would be based on incidence and cost data and would be capable of being tailored for use by participating MA plans to address the unique demographics and risk characteristics of its coverage pool.  Technology and analytical tools to investigate genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and cell stress pathways in neurons and glia of the aging and AD/ADRD brain. Such efforts might include the development of molecular-imaging technology and/or chip-based technology for in-vitro and in-vivo analysis of gene, epigenome, proteostasis, lipidomics, and metabolomics and metabolic function in the normal aging brain and in AD/ADRD.  Improved technology for the analysis of structural and functional brain connectivity at the cell, neural circuitry, and global network levels to define the trajectory of changes in brain structure and function in aging and AD/ADRD. Such technology might include the development of non-invasive methods and novel probes that monitor and manipulate the plasticity of neural circuits in the adult and aged nervous system. Further advances might include the development of novel markers of neural stem-cell function (e.g., proliferation, migration, and differentiation) as well as methods to assess the integration and function of stem cells in the aging and/or diseased nervous system.  Chip-based tools modeling human AD/ADRD for applications in AD/ADRD drug screening and development. Development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AD/ADRD has proven to be a lengthy, costly, and relatively unproductive process, with drug attrition rates of over 90%. Several studies have indicated the lack of appropriate preclinical AD/ADRD models as one of the barriers for successful development of AD/ADRD therapeutics. Although animal models of AD/ADRD have helped our understanding of AD/ADRD pathogenesis to some extent, key genes and proteins that are critical to the pathogenesis of this disease exhibit many inherent species-specific differences and, consequently, there is a critical need for translation platforms that can accurately and reproducibly mimic the AD/ADRD phenotype in vivo and be amenable to high-content screening and assay applications. Recent advances in stem-cell technology allow for successful generation of human neural-progenitor cells from skin cells of normal and AD/ADRD patients. This technology could be exploited to develop cell-type-specific AD/ADRD disease models by replicating AD/ADRD pathobiology on microfluidic chips. These chips could then provide a novel AD/ADRD model system that could be used in the translation process to:  perform high-throughput screening for drug discovery and drug efficacy,  develop in situ assays for measuring predictive biomarkers, and  validate therapeutic target(s);  Approaches using artificial intelligence to assist with recruitment and monitoring of study participants for clinical trials of treatments or preventives for AD/ADRD.  Clinical Research Operations Management System    NIA supports a central resource to NIA staff and extramural investigators to facilitate/support the conduct and management of clinical research. This resource, the Clinical Research Operations Management System (CROMS), is a comprehensive data management system to support the business functions, management, and oversight responsibilities of NIA grants that support the conduct of clinical research with human subjects. It is the expectation by NIA that all successful applicants will interface, integrate, or adapt their information system(s) and processes to interact with existing and future components of the CROMS as necessary, including the use of CROMS data templates as specified.",

His expertise in Wearable Technology, IoT, and Low-power electronics is directly applicable to creating devices for monitoring motor dysfunction, gait, and balance. Furthermore, his knowledge of Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI), LLMs, and Explainable AI (XAI) is a perfect fit for developing the 'engaging, computer-based cognitive-training programs' explicitly mentioned in the synopsis, enabling personalized, private, and accessible interventions on consumer devices.",

While his technology is a powerful enabler, the proposal must be driven by a deep understanding of the clinical problem. Success requires framing the project as an AD/ADRD solution enabled by novel technology, not as a technology project applied to AD/ADRD. His entrepreneurship background is a plus, aligning with the commercialization goal of the STTR program.",

His status as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' and his success with multiple NSF SBIR proposals are highly relevant and demonstrate a proven ability to secure commercialization-focused funding. However, the existence of an unsuccessful 'NIH SBIR Phase 1 proposal (AD).pdf' is a critical data point. It indicates a prior attempt in this exact area that fell short, but also provides an invaluable learning opportunity. His experience shows he understands the mechanics of SBIR/STTR proposals, but may need to refine his approach for the specific culture and review criteria of the NIH/NIA.",

The researcher can propose a novel fusion of his expertise: an integrated system combining a low-power wearable (for passive data collection on sleep, activity, and mobility) with an Edge AI-powered cognitive training application on a tablet. This system could provide adaptive, personalized interventions while using the passive data to contextualize cognitive performance. The addition of Explainable AI (XAI) could provide unprecedented feedback to clinicians and family members, representing a significant leap beyond current digital health tools for dementia care."

As part of the National Institute on Aging's (NIA) strategic plan to support the development of innovative strategies and therapies to prevent, diagnose, and treat AD/ADRD, this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)  invites applications to NIA's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. The aim of this FOA is to encourage research on, and the commercialization of, novel therapies, devices, products, and healthcare programs and practices to prevent the onset of AD/ADRD, and to reduce the burden that AD/ADRD places on individuals, their families, and society at large.    Examples of research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:    Prevention:    Behavioral, environmental, pharmacological, and nutritional interventions to prevent and/or remediate brain biochemical and/or neurophysiological changes caused by neurodegenerative diseases, including age-related sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or age-related decrements in balance and postural control, gait performance, and mobility.  Programs to support cognitive training to improve cognitive function in the elderly. Examples of topics appropriate for such programs include, but are not limited to, the following:  Rapid development of novel, engaging, computer-based cognitive-training programs based on empirically-established approaches using cognitive training to target a specific neural system/functional domain;  Augmentation of existing computerized cognitive interventions that can be individually tailored to engage, adapt, challenge, and optimize functional cognitive abilities to enhance cognitive functioning and performance of activities of daily living; and  Development of interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline, especially using technology platforms with wide acceptance among older adults.  Diagnosis:    Sensitive, specific, and standardized tests for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, including the development of new, cost-effective, minimally-invasive biomarkers that could be used for screening in the general population and in community settings. In addition, this FOA encourages research that would identify new biomarkers that could serve as surrogate measures for disease progression in AD/ADRD. Other advances might include the development of new instrumentation, imaging technology, related devices, and software packages for use in visualizing neural activity during cognitive, emotional, motor, or sensory behavior in older adults.  Biosensors and prosthetic devices, technologies, and related software development to aid in the assessment, diagnosis, and remediation of age-related cognitive decline.  Machine-learning tools and cognitive batteries that can be integrated into Electronic Medical Records (EMR) for diagnosis of MCI and AD/ADRD.  New approaches for the assessment of persons living with multiple chronic conditions in clinical practice, including development and validation of brief cognitive-screening measures.  Treatment:    Discovery, development, and/or evaluation of drugs and/or biological or natural products, including central nervous system delivery systems, to remediate age-related cognitive decline and treat the cognitive impairment and/or behavioral symptoms associated with MCI, AD/ADRD, and other dementias of aging. In addition, this FOA invitess research on therapies that might slow and/or reverse the course of AD/ADRD, or prevent them entirely through the application of systems-biology and systems-pharmacology approaches. Therapeutics addressing novel targets are of particular interest.  Clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of drug, nutritional, behavioral, cognitive, or other types of interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline and treat cognitive impairment and/or behavioral symptoms associated with MCI, AD/ADRD, and other dementias of aging, as well as to slow and/or reverse the course of AD/ADRD or to prevent their onset.  Care:    New technologies for in-home use, or for coordination or delivery of services to sustain in-home living for individuals living with MCI or AD/ADRD. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:  Systems and devices to evaluate, monitor, improve, or adapt to changes in cognition;  Improvements in health-service delivery;  Improvements in the preservation of functional independence;  Technologies supporting independent living and the conduct of everyday tasks at home;  Provision of information to healthcare providers and family members enabling assessment of patient needs and/or intervention(s); and  Promotion of effective communication and interaction between individuals living with dementia in the community or in institutional settings and their healthcare providers, friends, and family members.  Assistive robotics technology that can support a person in order to maintain or improve their independence, safety, and well-being when diagnosed with AD/ADRD and alleviate the burden of care. Such efforts might include the development of socially-assistive robots that can support engagement, social participation, and leisure activities of patients living with MCI and AD/ADRD.  Cost-effective technology to create dementia-friendly cities and environments for individuals diagnosed with AD/ADRD. This might include the development of alarm technology and tracking and location-monitoring devices to alert caregivers and others of the whereabouts of individuals living with AD/ADRD. Other advances might include innovative research to develop safer home environments, such as automatic shut-off valves for water (e.g. a sink could overflow when one forgets to turn off faucet) and electricity and gas (e.g. forgetting to turn off stove).  Comprehensive telecare systems that can be used to support independence and personal safety of an individual living with AD/ADRD and other dementias. Such telecare systems might include community alarms, medication reminders, sensors for floods or extreme temperatures, detection of absence from normal activities (e.g. sitting in a chair, going to bed), fall detection, and unobtrusive sensors to monitor activities of daily living and vital signs that can be reported to a healthcare provider. Other advances might include the development of technology that would allow for in-place monitoring of individuals at all stages of AD/ADRD. Ideally, such information would be integrated with other patient-relevant data in EMR.  Wearable, mobile, or other technology to enable direct, objective, and continuous data capture of everyday functions in individuals living with AD/ADRD.  Recent reviews of relevant scientific literature revealed the presence of disparities of care between diverse racial and ethnic minority populations of individuals with AD/ADRD. To address such disparities, this FOA encourages research to develop educational training programs for physicians, nursing assistants, home-care aids, and long-term-care services. These programs would focus on training healthcare staff to provide culturally-appropriate care to the patient at the right time and in the right setting.  Tools:    Novel technologies to monitor, assist, or maintain daily functioning of older individuals living with AD/ADRD and other cognitive impairments.  Manuals and training materials for existing evidence-based interventions that reduce the burden of caregiving for AD/ADRD caregivers which can be used by community-based agencies and/or healthcare organizations.  A tool that could be sold to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to allow them to accurately project future costs of caring for patients living with AD/ADRD and other forms of dementia. Such a tool would be based on incidence and cost data and would be capable of being tailored for use by participating MA plans to address the unique demographics and risk characteristics of its coverage pool.  Technology and analytical tools to investigate genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and cell stress pathways in neurons and glia of the aging and AD/ADRD brain. Such efforts might include the development of molecular-imaging technology and/or chip-based technology for in-vitro and in-vivo analysis of gene, epigenome, proteostasis, lipidomics, and metabolomics and metabolic function in the normal aging brain and in AD/ADRD.  Improved technology for the analysis of structural and functional brain connectivity at the cell, neural circuitry, and global network levels to define the trajectory of changes in brain structure and function in aging and AD/ADRD. Such technology might include the development of non-invasive methods and novel probes that monitor and manipulate the plasticity of neural circuits in the adult and aged nervous system. Further advances might include the development of novel markers of neural stem-cell function (e.g., proliferation, migration, and differentiation) as well as methods to assess the integration and function of stem cells in the aging and/or diseased nervous system.  Chip-based tools modeling human AD/ADRD for applications in AD/ADRD drug screening and development. Development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AD/ADRD has proven to be a lengthy, costly, and relatively unproductive process, with drug attrition rates of over 90%. Several studies have indicated the lack of appropriate preclinical AD/ADRD models as one of the barriers for successful development of AD/ADRD therapeutics. Although animal models of AD/ADRD have helped our understanding of AD/ADRD pathogenesis to some extent, key genes and proteins that are critical to the pathogenesis of this disease exhibit many inherent species-specific differences and, consequently, there is a critical need for translation platforms that can accurately and reproducibly mimic the AD/ADRD phenotype in vivo and be amenable to high-content screening and assay applications. Recent advances in stem-cell technology allow for successful generation of human neural-progenitor cells from skin cells of normal and AD/ADRD patients. This technology could be exploited to develop cell-type-specific AD/ADRD disease models by replicating AD/ADRD pathobiology on microfluidic chips. These chips could then provide a novel AD/ADRD model system that could be used in the translation process to:  perform high-throughput screening for drug discovery and drug efficacy,  develop in situ assays for measuring predictive biomarkers, and  validate therapeutic target(s).  Approaches using artificial intelligence to assist with recruitment and monitoring of study participants for clinical trials of treatments or preventives for AD/ADRD.  Clinical Research Operations Management System    NIA supports a central resource to NIA staff and extramural investigators to facilitate/support the conduct and management of clinical research. This resource, the Clinical Research Operations Management System (CROMS), is a comprehensive data management system to support the business functions, management, and oversight responsibilities of NIA grants that support the conduct of clinical research with human subjects. It is the expectation by NIA that all successful applicants will interface, integrate, or adapt their information system(s) and processes to interact with existing and future components of the CROMS as necessary, including the use of CROMS data templates as specified.",

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin platform to support space cargo deployment planning, simulation, and decision support for U.S. Space Force (USSF) logistics operations. The system—referred to as the Virtual Space Cargo Deployment Function (VS-CDF)—should enable mission planners to model, visualize, and optimize cargo movements across the full deployment lifecycle. Key capabilities include pre-mission scenario modeling, intelligent configuration of cargo based on vehicle, mission, and environmental constraints, and dynamic simulation of real-time logistics events and contingencies. The solution should support integration with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) logistics, mobility, and space operations systems to improve agility, reduce mission risk, and enhance sustainment readiness in multi-domain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The USSF requires advanced tools to plan, simulate, and execute logistics missions in the space domain. Current logistics modeling and planning systems are primarily designed for terrestrial operations and do not adequately account for the complexities of orbital mechanics, rapid launch events, intermodal cargo transfers, or the dynamic nature of space mobility. This limits planning agility, increases mission risk, and hinders the development of responsive and adaptive sustainment operations in line with Space Doctrine Publication 4-0 and the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   This topic seeks to develop a VS-CDF—a digital twin environment that enables real-time planning, simulation, optimization, and visualization of cargo deployment for space logistics. The VS-CDF should support both pre-mission and live mission phases, providing operational planners with AI-driven decision-support tools, immersive modeling capabilities, and integrated risk analytics. Key capabilities of the envisioned system may include:   - AI-based cargo optimization, considering constraints such as vehicle configuration, mass, power, volume, payload dynamics, and orbital conditions;  - Virtual mission planning and execution tools, enabling full-spectrum scenario modeling for rapid resupply, disaster response, and contingency operations;  - Digital twin visualization and intuitive user interfaces, including 3D modeling, augmented/virtual reality integration, and multi-modal human-machine interfaces (e.g., gesture, voice, touchscreen);  - Supply chain risk management and contingency simulation, to assess disruptions, prioritize routing, and inform cargo sequencing under degraded conditions;  - System interoperability and integration with DoD logistics networks and space operations systems, including the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture (COP) and Joint logistics nodes such as U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM),  Major Command (MAJCOM), and Field Command (FLDCOM).   The VS-CDF platform will enable more effective logistics decision-making for contested and distributed space operations, improving mission readiness, reducing deployment timelines, and enabling a shift toward predictive and energy-efficient sustainment practices.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: Under this D2P2 effort, the awardee will develop and demonstrate a functional VS-CDF—a digital twin software environment designed to support end-to-end planning, simulation, and decision support for space cargo logistics. The system will serve as a planning and analytics platform for mission stakeholders across the USSF and joint logistics enterprise, enabling predictive modeling, AI-based optimization, immersive visualization, and integration with real-time operational data. The Phase II objectives include:   - Develop an operational prototype of the VS-CDF digital twin environment, capable of simulating and optimizing cargo deployment across multiple mission types and logistics scenarios;  - Implement AI-enabled tools for cargo configuration, route planning, mission timeline optimization, and contingency response;  - Enable collaborative mission planning, supporting multi-user interaction across Joint, Coalition, and interagency logistics teams;  - Validate system functionality using live or historically representative DoD logistics data, assessing system accuracy, adaptability, and decision impact under realistic operational conditions.   Expected deliverables include:  - A fully functional prototype of the VS-CDF system, integrated with representative DoD logistics networks and space operations systems (e.g., USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM);  - Embedded AI models for cargo optimization, risk analysis, and scenario adaptation;  - Immersive visualization and user interface components, including 3D modeling, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) elements, or intuitive controls (as appropriate to the approach);  - A demonstration campaign conducted through logistics exercises, simulations, or wargames to assess mission utility;  - A final report documenting test results, user feedback, system performance metrics, and integration outcomes;  - A transition and commercialization roadmap outlining next steps for operational deployment and dual-use adoption.   The completed prototype will provide the USSF with a decision-support environment tailored to the unique challenges of space mobility and sustainment logistics. By enabling simulation-driven planning, risk-informed decision-making, and AI-powered optimization, the VS-CDF will enhance agility, readiness, and operational energy efficiency across both DoD and commercial logistics operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort will focus on transitioning the VS-CDF from a prototype to an operationally deployed capability supporting both military and commercial logistics ecosystems. The platform will serve as a decision support and simulation tool for complex, multi-domain cargo deployment planning—bridging the gap between terrestrial logistics systems and emerging space mobility operations. Military applications include:   - Provide a mission-ready logistics decision support environment for Space Systems Command (SSC), USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, and Joint logistics planners;  - Support operational planning and rapid deployment activities, including contingency logistics and distributed sustainment in contested domains;  - Integrate into training environments and exercise campaigns to enhance warfighter readiness and simulate space logistics missions under real-world constraints;  - Align with the USSF’s emphasis on sustainment agility, operational energy efficiency, and predictive supply chain planning.   Commercial applications include:  - Serve as a logistics optimization and simulation tool for aerospace, satellite launch, and space mobility companies managing commercial cargo operations;  - Enable advanced supply chain modeling and risk assessment for global logistics providers, intermodal transport planners, and commercial shipping networks;  - Support digital twin integration for defense contractors, airlines, and manufacturers seeking AI-based cargo planning and routing solutions;  - Extend to STEM education and academic research, offering a virtualized space logistics environment for training, experimentation, and collaboration.   For the transition plan, the DoD adoption will be pursued through coordination with SSC, USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, and FLDCOM for integration into operational planning tools and logistics networks. Commercial transition pathways will include partnerships with aerospace firms, logistics technology providers, and digital twin software vendors. The system will also be designed for interoperability with existing AI-based logistics tools, supporting scalable deployment across both DoD and private-sector operations.   The expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at Phase III Entry is TRL 8 or 9, following successful operational demonstration and validation.   REFERENCES:   1. U.S. Space Force. (2023, March).

The objective is to create a sophisticated software environment that allows mission planners to model, simulate, visualize, and optimize complex cargo deployments for space missions, addressing critical gaps left by terrestrial-focused planning tools. The VS-CDF must integrate AI for intelligent cargo configuration and route optimization, provide an intuitive visualization interface (potentially using 3D/AR/VR), and simulate contingencies to enhance supply chain resilience.\n\nKey capabilities required include expertise in AI/ML, digital twin technology, modeling and simulation, and enterprise software integration. Applicants must have already completed a 'Phase I-like' feasibility study that validates a strong product-mission fit with a specific USSF or Department of the Air Force (DAF) end-user. The project demands a clear pathway to integration with existing DoD logistics networks (e.g., USTRANSCOM, SSC). The innovation lies in creating a unified, purpose-built platform for the unique physics and operational constraints of the space domain. A successful project will result in a TRL 6-7 prototype with a clear transition plan for both military deployment (Phase III) and dual-use commercial applications in the growing aerospace and global logistics industries.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs),   their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW)   tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are   advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under   US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE:    DTRA seeks a software solution which uses the Persistent Systems Wave Relay API and SDK to   integrate RF signal information such as Time of Flight (ToF), Time Distance of Arrival (TDoA), and   Asymmetrical Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging (ADS-TDR) into the Thales InterSense IS-1500 Visual   Inertial Tracking software to provide an improved local positioning solution for uncrewed and worn   sensors during tactical operations. The Thales InterSense IS-1500 software uses inertial and visual   technologies to affect local positioning; however, IMU’s are prone to error accumulation over time and   visual tracking is impacted by low light conditions and other environmental complexities [1]. Persistent   Systems Wave Relay MANET radios are used extensively within DTRA and the greater CBRN/CWMD   community for sensor communications and the Wave Relay API provides data which can be used to   enhance current inertial and optical tracking devices. Attempts to use RF signal data have limitations due   to signal strength and interference [2]. The Wave Relay wave form provides up to 10 watts of power   using 3 chain Multi-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) and mesh networking, offering a solution to both   signal strength and interference limitations. Fusing the existing visual and inertial data with the Wave   Relay signal information would provide a more reliable and accurate local positioning solution in GPS   denied and contested areas. This solution would provide accurate positioning for CBRN sensors in   manned and unmanned search operations. This technology would be integrated into the TAK North Star   Plug-in, providing any Wave Relay and IS-1500 user with a robust local positioning solution.      DESCRIPTION:    The technology should use the Wave Relay API and SDK to determine which variables to leverage and   how to integrate them into the existing IS-1500 software. The solution should be integrated into the TAK   North Star Plug-in. The solution should provide accuracy within 1 meter in an area 300 meters by 300   meters without reliance on GPS/GNSS during periods of darkness. The final product should be   integrated into the TAK North Star Plug-in as a capability available for any user with the appropriate   hardware (End User Device, MPU5 Wave Relay Radio, and IS-1500).      PHASE I:    Demonstrate 1 meter accuracy throughout a 300-meter by 300-meter area. The testable area should be complex (non-line of sight) requiring RF repeater nodes to affect communications.      The solution should be dynamic, meaning multiple users should be able to achieve 1 meter accuracy simultaneously. The accuracy should not degrade or drift over time beyond 1 meter. The Phase I deliverable should be a prototype software for the IS-1500 Visual Inertial Sensor.      The technology should integrate into the users TAK system; End User Device, IS-1500, CBRN Sensor, and MPU5 Wave Relay Radio.      Initial testing of the prototype should be conducted, and results should be documented and provided in the final report.      A demonstration should be provided for DTRA government representative, and a plan should also be submitted outlining the approach for Phase II if required.      PHASE II:    Refine the technology IAW the sponsor/end user feedback      Integrate the latest Wave Relay API      Perform maritime testing      Perform subterranean testing      Investigate performance in extreme/limited coms environments where communication is intermittent or lost for up to 5 minutes      Provide 3 IS-1500 units with the software solution to DTRA for testing      Provide Software to TAK Product Center for validation      Provide a demonstration to government representatives      Provide a final report, documentation, and user guides         PHASE III:    Further develop the technology based on the DTRA feedback to improve accuracy and resilience   A final release of software with a continuous modernizations strategy with maintains currency with TAK Product Center, Wave Relay, IS-1500, and Android OS      Although additional funding may be provided through DoD sources, the awardee should look to other public or private sector funding sources for assistance with transition and commercialization.

OBJECTIVE:    DTRA seeks a software solution which uses the Persistent Systems Wave Relay API and SDK to   integrate RF signal information such as Time of Flight (ToF), Time Distance of Arrival (TDoA), and   Asymmetrical Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging (ADS-TDR) into the Thales InterSense IS-1500 Visual   Inertial Tracking software to provide an improved local positioning solution for uncrewed and worn   sensors during tactical operations. The Thales InterSense IS-1500 software uses inertial and visual   technologies to affect local positioning; however, IMU’s are prone to error accumulation over time and   visual tracking is impacted by low light conditions and other environmental complexities [1]. Persistent   Systems Wave Relay MANET radios are used extensively within DTRA and the greater CBRN/CWMD   community for sensor communications and the Wave Relay API provides data which can be used to   enhance current inertial and optical tracking devices. Attempts to use RF signal data have limitations due   to signal strength and interference [2]. The Wave Relay wave form provides up to 10 watts of power   using 3 chain Multi-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) and mesh networking, offering a solution to both   signal strength and interference limitations. Fusing the existing visual and inertial data with the Wave   Relay signal information would provide a more reliable and accurate local positioning solution in GPS   denied and contested areas. This solution would provide accurate positioning for CBRN sensors in   manned and unmanned search operations. This technology would be integrated into the TAK North Star   Plug-in, providing any Wave Relay and IS-1500 user with a robust local positioning solution.      DESCRIPTION:    The technology should use the Wave Relay API and SDK to determine which variables to leverage and   how to integrate them into the existing IS-1500 software. The solution should be integrated into the TAK   North Star Plug-in. The solution should provide accuracy within 1 meter in an area 300 meters by 300   meters without reliance on GPS/GNSS during periods of darkness. The final product should be   integrated into the TAK North Star Plug-in as a capability available for any user with the appropriate   hardware (End User Device, MPU5 Wave Relay Radio, and IS-1500).      PHASE I:    Demonstrate 1 meter accuracy throughout a 300-meter by 300-meter area. The testable area should be complex (non-line of sight) requiring RF repeater nodes to affect communications.      The solution should be dynamic, meaning multiple users should be able to achieve 1 meter accuracy simultaneously. The accuracy should not degrade or drift over time beyond 1 meter. The Phase I deliverable should be a prototype software for the IS-1500 Visual Inertial Sensor.      The technology should integrate into the users TAK system; End User Device, IS-1500, CBRN Sensor, and MPU5 Wave Relay Radio.      Initial testing of the prototype should be conducted, and results should be documented and provided in the final report.      A demonstration should be provided for DTRA government representative, and a plan should also be submitted outlining the approach for Phase II if required.      PHASE II:    Refine the technology IAW the sponsor/end user feedback      Integrate the latest Wave Relay API      Perform maritime testing      Perform subterranean testing      Investigate performance in extreme/limited coms environments where communication is intermittent or lost for up to 5 minutes      Provide 3 IS-1500 units with the software solution to DTRA for testing      Provide Software to TAK Product Center for validation      Provide a demonstration to government representatives      Provide a final report, documentation, and user guides         PHASE III:    Further develop the technology based on the DTRA feedback to improve accuracy and resilience   A final release of software with a continuous modernizations strategy with maintains currency with TAK Product Center, Wave Relay, IS-1500, and Android OS      Although additional funding may be provided through DoD sources, the awardee should look to other public or private sector funding sources for assistance with transition and commercialization. There is high demand for non-GPS positioning solutions for manned and uncrewed operations in the DoD, state and local government CBRN/CWMD enterprise      KEYWORDS: CBRN; Autonomous, Navigation, GPS Denied, PNT, Position Navigation Timing, Local Positioning; CWMD, Counter Proliferation; Sensor; ATAK; Situational Awareness      REFERENCES:   1.

This fusion aims to overcome the inherent limitations of standalone systems: Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are prone to error accumulation (drift) over time, and visual tracking is unreliable in low-light conditions or complex environments. By using the high-power, MIMO, and mesh networking capabilities of Wave Relay radios, the solution should mitigate RF signal strength and interference issues. The resulting technology will provide a more reliable and accurate local positioning solution for both uncrewed and human-worn CBRN sensors during tactical search operations in GPS-denied and contested areas. The final software is expected to be integrated into the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) North Star Plug-in, making it accessible to any user equipped with an End User Device, MPU5 Wave Relay Radio, and an IS-1500 sensor.",

The resulting technology must overcome the individual limitations of each sensor type, such as IMU drift and visual tracking failures in low light. The final software deliverable will be a plug-in for the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) North Star ecosystem, providing enhanced situational awareness for CBRN and CWMD missions.\n\nKey capabilities required include deep expertise in sensor fusion algorithms (e.g., Kalman filtering), signal processing, and software engineering for systems integration with proprietary APIs/SDKs. Experience with the Wave Relay MANET, visual-inertial odometry, and TAK plugin development is critical. The innovation potential is high, focusing on a novel algorithm to achieve ≤ 1-meter accuracy in complex, non-line-of-sight environments for multiple simultaneous users. The project requires close adherence to ITAR/EAR regulations and a clear strategy for collaboration with technology providers (Persistent Systems, Thales) and the government's TAK Product Center for validation.

          "synopsis": "Purpose  The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support applications from small business concerns (SBC) to develop technologies for commercialization to address health-related social needs that impact substance use disorders (SUD), excluding alcohol use disorder.  Background  In 2021, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) noted that 61 million people ages 12 and older used illicit drugs in the past year. Nationwide, the Association of American Medical Colleges has reported 21 million people with a SUD, and just 11% of them received treatment. With so many individuals struggling with SUD, and very few receiving treatment, the SUD crisis will worsen. It will take a more comprehensive approach to address the crisis; including addressing the individual's health-related social needs (HRSN) that are influenced by their living conditions.  The health of people struggling with SUD is inextricably bound to their social environment. Social determinants of health (SDH) can directly shape health risk behaviors. Moreover, public health experts have long recognized the impact of SDH on health outcomes. While SDH are seen as the surrounding conditions of people’s existence, HRSN are the individual’s unique social conditions from five core categories established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Accountable Health Communities Model (housing instability, food insecurity, nonmedical transportation, utility needs, and personal safety) resulting from fundamental SDH. SDH manifest in the living conditions and resources that indirectly exacerbate the consequences of drug use. For example, inadequate housing can increase the likelihood of infectious disease transmission, stable social relationships can offer protective financial and emotional resources, and more cohesive neighborhoods are more likely to provide appropriate support and care. HRSN are displayed as people struggling with SUD being able to pay their utility bills while living in inadequate housing, being able to purchase food without sacrificing money for rent, and being able to navigate their community without concern for their personal safety. While SDH, such as poverty, homelessness, and incarceration, among others, impact behaviors that lead to SUD, being able to identify and address the unique HRSN of people struggling with SUD, by using technology, can serve as a catalyst to filling the service gaps that government and the medical community cannot do alone. The public and private sectors, utilizing the infinite capabilities of technology, can collaborate to create new paths and form new business models to address the many direct health-related social needs of people already struggling with SUD.  Research Objectives  A variety of products addressing the individual-level factors of HRSN should be considered to confront SUD. Additionally, technology, such as telemedicine and mobile health applications, provide an opportunity to address HRSN with the ability to provide tested, accessible, and ongoing solutions for individuals who are the most at-risk for these risk factors that impact SUD. According to SAMHSA, technology has several advantages in addressing Substance SUD including decreased waiting periods, decreased stigma impact, and increased privacy. The advantages of technology are also exhibited in its capability to make treatment services more accessible and convenient which can aid to improve SUD outcomes and reduce disparities.  Regarding this NOFO, a product is any source of value for the end-users and customers. A product can be a physical/tangible device as well as digital services, software as a service, or non-physical/non-tangible products (including but not limited to digital applications, digital platforms, or service models). These and other comparable examples could be considered eligible products. Products can be the result of original scientific research, recycled existing technology for SUD, extension of an observation into SUD area, development of a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that reveals currently unseen value, or the delivery of a product or service to disregarded consumers.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) supports the development of evidence-based SUD care and treatment technology from multiple funding opportunities published elsewhere. The eligible small businesses can submit applications focusing on products that reduce costs, time, and/or increase access in addressing HRSN including, but not limited to, housing instability, non-medical transportation, food insecurity, utility needs, and personal safety. The products should provide the best feasible and accessible opportunities for the intended end-users to measurably improve their HRSN and SUD. Products of interest that address, but are not limited to, the following HRSN include:  Access to housing services. Soft skills development and/or job training (e.g., in entrepreneurship, literacy and financial literacy, IT skills) for employment. Stigma and nurture compassion. Family healthy behaviors, social skills, community opportunities, and productive social involvement. Social stability (community, tradition, faith, family), self-regulation and resilience. Well-being (mental, physical, spiritual), communal belonging, and positive productivity. Social support networks for recovery, engagement with care, and/or access to needed services. Successful community reintegration for formerly incarcerated people. Social needs service engagement and coordination among justice-involved organizations. Employer education to hire, retain, and facilitate treatment for employees seeking help for SUD. Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO  The following will be deemed not responsive and will be returned without review  Applications solely focused on the research and development of solutions to provide medical care and/or treatment. Applications focusing solely on health-related social needs in the context of Alcohol Use Disorders. The SBIR/STTR program is a phased program.  The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization.  An overall objective of the SBIR and STTR programs is to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federally supported research and development. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, the small business is expected to fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal).  Three types of applications are accepted in response to this NOFO:  Phase I. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization prior to proceeding to Phase II.  Fast-Track (Phase I/ Phase II) applications should include a clear rationale of feasibility of the proposed approach and/ or technology application in SUD area; demonstrate a high probability of commercialization; propose clear, appropriate, meaningful, and measurable goals (milestones) to be achieved prior to initiating Phase II; and indicate potential Phase III support/interest (non-SBIR/STTR) from future commercialization partners.  An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  Phase II. The objective of Phase II (as a part of Fast Track applications) is to continue the R&D efforts initiated in Phase I to advance technologies to potential commercialization. Projects proposed for Phase II are based on the results achieved in Phase I (or equivalent) and aim to demonstrate scientific and technical merit and commercial potential. NIDA seeks to determine that both technical feasibility and commercial feasibility are established in Phase I before making the decision about proceeding to Phase II.  Special Considerations  NIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards. Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.  See Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.

This RFA (RFA-DA-25-048) funds the creation of technologies—such as mobile apps, digital platforms, and novel service models—that tackle key barriers to recovery like housing instability, food insecurity, unemployment, and lack of transportation. The program operates in phases: Phase I offers up to $400k for 12 months to establish technical feasibility, and Phase II provides up to $2M for 24 months to develop a market-ready prototype. A Fast-Track option combines both phases.\n\nSuccessful applicants will be U.S.-based small businesses with a strong, interdisciplinary team combining technical, scientific, and business expertise. Key capabilities needed include software development, user-centered design, and knowledge of SUD and social services. The core of the application is a dual focus on rigorous R&D and a robust commercialization plan detailing the business model and path to market sustainability. Innovation is key, but can be expressed through novel technology, a new business model, or a new application of existing tech. Strong partnerships with community organizations, healthcare systems, or potential customers are critical for demonstrating market need and a viable implementation pathway. This is an ideal opportunity for innovators aiming to create a scalable, commercially successful product that has a significant social impact on the SUD crisis."
