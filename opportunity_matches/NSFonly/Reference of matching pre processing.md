## Analysis Errors

### Summary
- **Total Analysis Errors:** 0
- **Impact:** These opportunities failed during AI analysis processing

### Detailed Results

*No analysis errors to report.*


## Recommendations

### For 403 Forbidden Errors
1. **NSF URL Access:** The NSF website may be blocking automated access to certain pages
2. **Alternative Approach:** Consider using NSF's official API or RSS feeds if available
3. **Manual Review:** High-priority opportunities with 403 errors may need manual review

### For Analysis Errors
1. **Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors
2. **Input Validation:** Enhance input validation for malformed opportunity data
3. **Fallback Analysis:** Use basic analysis for opportunities that fail comprehensive analysis

### Processing Optimization
1. **Rate Limiting:** Current 150 RPM limit appears appropriate
2. **Parallel Processing:** 5 workers provided good throughput
3. **Error Handling:** Robust error handling allowed processing to continue despite individual failures

## Technical Details

- **Processing Duration:** Approximately 557.7 minutes (estimated)
- **API Calls:** ~1434 total calls (analysis + URL fetching)
- **Output File:** FundingOpportunitiesManual/nsf_funding_semantic.json
- **Enhancement Features:** Enhanced descriptions, technical focus areas, semantic keywords, strategic context
