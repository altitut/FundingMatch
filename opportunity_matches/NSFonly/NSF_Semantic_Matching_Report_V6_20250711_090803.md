## High-Scoring Opportunities (≥70) - Detailed Analysis


### 1. NSF Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer Fast-Track Pilot Programs (SBIR-STTR Fast-Track) (Score: 98)

**Program ID:** 506271  
**Compatibility Score:** 98/100  
**Summary:** This is an exceptional match due to the researcher's proven track record with multiple successful NSF SBIR awards, deep expertise in the program's target technology areas (AI/Engineering), and explicit focus on technology commercialization.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is a direct and powerful fit for this opportunity. The NSF SBIR program seeks to fund the retirement of technical risk to create a proof-of-concept, and Dr. Costilla Reyes's skills in Anomaly Detection, LLMs, Edge AI, Computer Vision, and IoT are at the forefront of deep-tech innovation. His work in Manufacturing Quality Assurance and Smart Agriculture Technologies provides clear, high-impact application areas. His expertise in Explainable AI (XAI) and Low-power electronics directly addresses key technical challenges in bringing advanced AI to market, demonstrating a mature understanding of the development lifecycle beyond pure algorithms.
- **Research Domain Match:** The alignment is perfect. The opportunity explicitly lists 'artificial_intelligence' and 'engineering_technology' as key research areas. Dr. Costilla Reyes's research domains are Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning, which are synonymous with the program's focus. His projects are inherently interdisciplinary, blending core CS/AI principles with practical engineering applications, which is the exact profile the NSF SBIR/STTR program is designed to support.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's experience is the most compelling aspect of this match. As a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with a history of securing over $1.2M, he is already well-positioned. Critically, his list of successful proposals includes multiple NSF SBIR awards (e.g., 'NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf', 'NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf'). This demonstrates that he not only has the technical and entrepreneurial skills but also a deep, practical understanding of the NSF's specific criteria for commercial potential, intellectual merit, and broader impacts within the SBIR framework. This prior success significantly de-risks a future application in the eyes of reviewers.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is extremely high. The combination of cutting-edge expertise in areas like LLMs, watermarking for digital assets, and Machine Learning at the Edge opens numerous avenues for groundbreaking commercial products. He could propose a novel system for protecting AI models from theft using advanced watermarking, an ultra-efficient Edge AI for predictive maintenance in manufacturing, or an XAI-driven system for quality assurance. These are not incremental improvements but potentially transformative technologies with clear market needs, aligning perfectly with the NSF's goal of funding innovations with broad societal and economic impacts.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This successful Phase II proposal is the best template for a Fast-Track application. The strategy is to adapt its comprehensive structure, which already outlines a full R&D and commercialization plan. The new proposal should clearly delineate Phase I objectives (focused on technical feasibility and risk retirement) and Phase II objectives (prototype development and market entry prep), with explicit go/no-go milestones connecting the two.

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 95/100  
**Summary:** This is an ideal supplemental funding opportunity for the researcher provided he has a currently active NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II award, as it is specifically designed to leverage his entrepreneurial experience and advanced technical expertise to secure commercial partnerships.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's key technical expertise in Anomaly Detection, LLMs, Edge AI, IoT, and Computer Vision in Manufacturing aligns perfectly with the 'engineering_technology' focus of the NSF SBIR/STTR program. The TECP supplement is intended for targeted R&D to meet a partner's needs, and the researcher's skills are directly applicable to developing specific proofs-of-concept, performance benchmarks, or feature enhancements (e.g., optimizing an Edge AI model for a partner's specific hardware) that would be required for commercial adoption.
- **Research Domain Match:** The match is perfect. The researcher's domains are Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning, which are core areas for the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) that manages this program. His work in applied areas like Manufacturing Quality Assurance, Smart Agriculture, and Digital IP Protection demonstrates a clear path from research to commercial application, which is the central theme of the TECP supplement.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's profile as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with over $1.2M in funding and a history of successful proposals, including filenames like 'NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf', indicates direct and highly relevant experience with the NSF SBIR/STTR program. This prior success and familiarity with the NSF system are critical, as the TECP opportunity is exclusively for current Phase II awardees. His experience is not just relevant; it is a prerequisite.
- **Innovation Potential:** High. The researcher's work at the intersection of cutting-edge AI and practical applications (e.g., watermarking for LLMs, on-device AI for manufacturing) is highly innovative. The TECP supplement would allow him to directly translate this innovation into a commercially viable product by funding the final, crucial R&D steps needed to de-risk the technology for a strategic partner, thereby accelerating market entry and demonstrating the commercial impact of his NSF-funded research.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is not about adapting a past proposal, but about building upon the active Phase II project it represents. The strategy is to draft a TECP supplemental funding request that: 1) Identifies a specific commercial partner interested in the AutoML On-Device AI technology. 2) Clearly defines the technical milestone or proof-of-concept the partner requires before committing (e.g., achieving a specific inference speed on their proprietary hardware, demonstrating a certain accuracy level on their private dataset). 3) Outlines a concise work plan (scope, budget up to 20% of the Phase II award, and timeline) to achieve this milestone. 4) Secures a powerful, detailed letter of support from the partner confirming these requirements and their intent to partner upon successful completion.
  - Reusable Elements: The supplement request should leverage the 'Project Description' from the original Phase II proposal to provide context. Reusable elements include: the core technology description, the problem being solved, the value proposition, the team's qualifications, and the original commercialization plan (which the TECP will now enhance and accelerate).

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal must be positioned as a low-risk, high-impact investment for NSF. The narrative should focus on leveraging NSF's existing Phase II investment to achieve a tangible commercial outcome. The key is to frame the request not as 'more research' but as 'customer-driven product validation'. The story should be: 'Our core technology developed under Phase II is successful, and a major commercial partner (e.g., a large manufacturer) wants to adopt it. They require one final technical validation, and this TECP funding is the catalyst to close the deal, generating revenue and jobs, and validating NSF's investment.'

#### Success Factors
- **Possession of an Active NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II Award:** This is the absolute, non-negotiable eligibility requirement. The award must not be in a no-cost extension period.
- **A Strong, Committed Commercial Partner:** The quality and commitment of the partner are paramount. The letter of support must be specific, on official letterhead, and clearly state the business opportunity, the technical gap the TECP will fill, and the commercial action the partner will take upon successful completion of the supplemental work (e.g., a licensing agreement, a strategic investment, a large purchase order).
- **A Well-Defined Technical Scope:** The proposed work must be distinct from the original Phase II objectives and directly tied to the partner's requirements. A clear, concise plan that shows how the funds will be used to bridge this specific technical gap is essential for a successful request.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **Confirming Eligibility:** The single biggest hurdle is verifying that the researcher currently holds an NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II award that is active and has at least 6 months remaining before its end date. If his award is expired or in a no-cost extension, he is ineligible.
- **Securing a Specific Partner Commitment:** Moving a potential partner from expressing general interest to signing a detailed letter that outlines technical requirements and future commercial intent can be challenging. This requires significant business development effort prior to submitting the TECP request.

For instance, he could propose a framework that automatically generates and deploys hyper-efficient machine learning models to remote, energy-harvesting sensors for real-time prediction of climate-related hazards like wildfires, flash floods, or grid instability. This moves beyond simple data collection to providing predictive, actionable intelligence at the source, representing a major leap forward for climate resilience.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful proposal is an ideal candidate for adaptation. The core idea of 'Outlier Detection for Remote Asset Monitoring' should be reframed to explicitly address a climate change problem highlighted by the CAS DCL. Instead of a general 'asset monitoring' pitch, it should be repositioned as 'AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Renewable Energy Infrastructure Resilience' or 'Smart Monitoring of Water Infrastructure for Climate Adaptation'. The proposal should be submitted to a relevant NSF SBIR/STTR topic area or a core program within the Engineering (ENG) directorate (e.g., CMMI), and it must prominently reference this DCL (nsf21124) in the project description to signal its alignment with NSF's strategic priorities.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical core of the proposal, including the literature review on anomaly detection algorithms, the architecture for IoT/Edge AI systems, and the preliminary data, can be reused. The primary adaptation required is in the problem framing, statement of need, broader impacts, and commercial opportunity sections, which must be rewritten to focus squarely on a climate change mitigation or adaptation application.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to leverage his established credibility with the NSF SBIR program. He should identify a specific, high-impact climate problem where his technology offers a clear advantage. The proposal narrative should be framed as a direct response to the CAS DCL, building upon his prior successful work in on-device AI. He should strongly consider forming a partnership with a domain expert (e.g., a climate scientist, civil engineer, or an energy company) to strengthen the application's credibility and impact. Before submitting, he should contact the relevant Program Director, mentioning his prior awards and pitching his new climate-focused idea, perhaps using the cas@nsf.gov email for initial guidance as suggested in the DCL.

#### Success Factors
- **Proven NSF SBIR Success:** His history of winning Phase I and II SBIR grants demonstrates to reviewers that he can deliver on commercially-relevant, use-inspired research, a key tenet of this DCL.
- **High-Relevance Technical Skills:** His expertise in Edge AI, IoT, and anomaly detection directly maps to the technological needs for creating advanced climate monitoring, prediction, and resilience solutions.
- **Entrepreneurial Focus:** His profile as an academic entrepreneur is precisely the persona NSF wishes to engage through this initiative, especially via the SBIR/STTR pathway which is explicitly encouraged.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **Demonstrating Climate Domain Expertise:** While his technical skills are strong, his profile lacks explicit expertise in climate science, environmental science, or civil engineering. A proposal would be significantly strengthened by partnering with a co-PI or including letters of collaboration from experts in the specific climate application area (e.g., grid management, hydrology, forestry).
- **Navigating the DCL Process:** The main challenge is not the idea itself, but executing the submission correctly. He must identify the most suitable core program or SBIR topic to submit *to*, as the DCL is not a receiving program. He needs to tailor the proposal to the specific criteria of that target program while simultaneously weaving in the language and goals of the CAS DCL to catch the attention of reviewers and program staff.

### 10. Innovation Corps Teams Program (Score: 95)

**Program ID:** 504672  
**Compatibility Score:** 95/100  
**Summary:** This program is an exceptional match for Dr. Reyes, whose deep-tech expertise and demonstrated commercialization drive align perfectly with the I-Corps mission, provided he can base the proposal on a recent, qualifying NSF award.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Reyes' technical expertise is a direct fit for the I-Corps program's focus on "deep technologies." His skills in Anomaly/Outlier Detection, Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI), IoT, and watermarking for digital IP protection are precisely the types of fundamental, science-based innovations that I-Corps aims to translate. These technologies, particularly in applications like Manufacturing Quality Assurance and Smart Agriculture, represent significant engineering and computer science advancements with clear commercial potential that require the rigorous market validation I-Corps provides.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are perfectly aligned with the opportunity's listed research areas of 'artificial_intelligence' and 'engineering_technology'. His work sits at the nexus of these fields, which is a core focus area for NSF's translational efforts. I-Corps is designed to support researchers from these exact domains in exploring the commercial landscape for their discoveries.
- **Experience Relevance:** Dr. Reyes' profile as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with extensive experience in seeking commercialization-focused funding (NSF SBIR, PFI) makes him an ideal candidate. His previous proposals, even the unsuccessful ones, demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of the need to bridge the gap between research and market. This experience means he is already familiar with the language of commercialization and understands the 'valley of death,' which will make him highly credible in discussions with an NSF Program Officer and in the proposal itself. He is not a typical academic; he is already oriented towards the program's goals.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovative contributions is very high. By applying the I-Corps methodology to his work in areas like XAI for manufacturing or LLMs for IP protection, Dr. Reyes can uncover novel business models and market applications that are not immediately obvious. The process could pivot his technology towards a more impactful or profitable market segment, leading to a stronger foundation for a future deep technology venture (DTV), which is a primary goal of the I-Corps program.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful PFI proposal is the ideal starting point. Reframe the entire document away from a research/development plan and towards a commercial validation plan. The core technology description can be reused, but the project narrative must be rewritten to present the proposed market and value proposition as a set of *hypotheses* that will be tested through the I-Corps customer discovery process (i.e., 100+ interviews). The goal is not to build the technology, but to find out if anyone would buy it.
  - Reusable Elements: The detailed description of the outlier detection technology, the initial (hypothetical) identification of the problem in remote asset monitoring, and the biographical sketches of the technical team members can be directly reused.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: While this was a successful SBIR proposal, its core concepts can be adapted for a new, related technology derived from a different NSF-funded project. The commercialization plan section of the SBIR can be repurposed as the 'starting hypotheses' for the I-Corps business model canvas. The proposal should clearly state that the I-Corps grant will be used to de-risk the commercial assumptions for a potential future SBIR or spin-out company.
  - Reusable Elements: The market analysis, customer profile descriptions, and competitive landscape sections can be used as the foundation for the initial set of hypotheses to be tested. The technical description of AutoML and On-Device AI provides a strong 'deep tech' foundation.

**Strategic Positioning:** The key to a successful submission is to embrace that I-Corps is not a research grant. The strategy should be: 1) **Verify Lineage:** Immediately identify a fundamental research NSF award (active within the last 5 years) that is the genesis of the technology he wants to explore. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite. 2) **Form the Team:** Dr. Reyes is the perfect Technical Lead (TL). He must recruit an entrepreneurial-minded student/postdoc as the Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) and a credible Industry Mentor (IM) with relevant market experience. 3) **Pitch the Program Officer:** Prepare a 1-page executive summary based on the 'Outlier Detection' or 'AutoML' concepts. Frame it around the business model hypotheses and the team's commitment to the customer discovery process. Use this to secure the mandatory invitation to submit. 4) **Write for Commercial Validation:** The proposal narrative must focus on the questions to be answered, the customer segments to be interviewed, and the business model canvas, not on technical research milestones.

#### Success Factors
- **Proven Commercialization Intent:** Dr. Reyes' history of applying for NSF SBIR and PFI grants provides powerful evidence that he is serious about technology translation, a key attribute NSF looks for in I-Corps candidates.
- **Strong 'Deep Tech' Portfolio:** His expertise in AI/ML, IoT, and cybersecurity provides a rich set of technologies that are prime candidates for the I-Corps program, each with multiple potential market applications to explore.
- **Ideal Candidate Profile:** As an 'Academic Entrepreneur,' he perfectly embodies the spirit of the I-Corps Technical Lead, possessing both the deep technical knowledge and the motivation to see it impact society.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **The Lineage Requirement:** This is the most critical and immediate challenge. He MUST have a prior or current NSF award (active in the last five years) that serves as the direct technical foundation for the proposed I-Corps project. Without this, he is ineligible.
- **Team Formation:** Securing a committed and high-quality Entrepreneurial Lead (the student/postdoc who will conduct most of the 100+ interviews) and a relevant, experienced Industry Mentor can be difficult and time-consuming. The strength of the full three-person team is a major review criterion.

### 11. Small Business/Engineering Research Center Collaborative Opportunity (SECO) - Supplemental Funding Opportunity for Current SBIR/STTR Phase II Awardees (Score: 95)

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 95/100  
**Summary:** This is an extremely strong match, as the opportunity is specifically designed for researchers like Alfredo Costilla Reyes who are leading an active NSF SBIR Phase II award and can leverage an Engineering Research Center (ERC) to accelerate commercialization.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned. His skills in Manufacturing Quality Assurance, Computer Vision in Manufacturing, IoT, Edge AI, and Energy Harvesting Systems for IoT are directly applicable to the applied research and technology translation missions of many NSF Engineering Research Centers. An ERC partner could provide advanced manufacturing testbeds, specialized equipment, or unique datasets to validate and scale his technologies, directly addressing the goals of the SECO program.
- **Research Domain Match:** The match is perfect. The opportunity's focus on 'engineering_technology' is a core domain for the researcher. More importantly, his demonstrated focus on 'Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization' is the central theme of this supplemental funding. The program aims to bridge the gap between SBIR-funded research and market entry, which aligns precisely with the researcher's profile as an 'Academic Entrepreneur'.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's experience is ideal. The most critical eligibility requirement is being a current NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II awardee. The presence of 'NSF23_SBIR_ph2_ProjectDescription.pdf' and 'NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf' in his successful proposals list strongly indicates he meets this prerequisite. His track record of securing over $1.2M in funding demonstrates his ability to write compelling, successful NSF proposals, a key indicator of potential success with this supplement.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is high and centers on synergy. By combining his Phase II innovation (e.g., 'AutoML_OnDeviceAI') with the resources of an ERC, he can solve critical scale-up or implementation challenges. For example, he could integrate his Edge AI models with an ERC's industrial IoT network or use their advanced fabrication facilities to ruggedize his hardware. This collaboration would not just advance his technology but would create an innovative model for small business-university partnership, accelerating the transition of his product from a prototype to a market-ready solution.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF23_SBIR_ph2_ProjectDescription.pdf (or a similar active Phase II award)**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is not about adapting a past proposal but rather writing a supplement *to* the active Phase II award. The strategy is to: 1) Identify a key commercialization hurdle in the current Phase II project (e.g., testing at scale, need for a specific industrial dataset, validation on certified equipment). 2) Find an NSF ERC with the unique resources to overcome this hurdle. 3) Frame the supplemental request as a targeted, 12-month project with the ERC to solve this specific problem, thereby de-risking the path to market.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire background, problem statement, innovation, and commercial opportunity sections from the original Phase II proposal can be reused as context. The new material will be the 'Collaborative Research Plan' with the ERC, a new budget, a timeline for the supplemental work, and the mandatory Letter of Endorsement from the ERC Center Director.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to position the supplement as a critical catalyst for commercial success. He must first engage his current NSF SBIR Program Director to socialize the idea. Then, he should research active NSF ERCs to find one with a clear alignment (e.g., an ERC for Advanced Manufacturing for his QA work, or a Center for Clean Energy for his energy harvesting systems). The proposal must emphasize the mutual benefit: his company gains access to unique resources, and the ERC strengthens its technology transfer mission and industry engagement. The request should be framed as a logical and essential next step in the commercialization roadmap outlined in his original Phase II plan.

#### Success Factors
- Confirming active status of an NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II award and that it is within the 18-month window or that the Program Director will grant an exception.
- Identifying a highly aligned ERC partner and securing a strong, detailed Letter of Endorsement from the Center Director that outlines the specific value of the collaboration.
- Clearly articulating a focused, achievable 12-month work plan that directly addresses a specific commercialization barrier and demonstrates a high ROI for the supplemental funds.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The primary challenge is external: identifying the right ERC and building the relationship necessary to secure a formal partnership and endorsement. This requires significant networking and outreach.
- The work scope must be tightly defined. A 20% budget increase and 12-month timeline are restrictive, so the proposed collaboration must be a surgical strike on a key problem, not a broad, open-ended research exploration.

### 12. Verticals-enabling Intelligent Network Systems (VINES) (Score: 92)

**Program ID:** 506396  
**Compatibility Score:** 92/100  
**Summary:** This is an exceptionally strong match, particularly for Track 2, as the researcher's expertise in vertical applications like manufacturing/agriculture, Edge AI, and technology commercialization aligns perfectly with the VINES program's goal of developing and translating NextG network-enabled solutions.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is highly aligned with the core needs of the VINES program. His proficiency in 'ML at the Edge (Edge AI)', 'IoT', 'Low-power electronics', 'Computer Vision in Manufacturing', and 'Smart Agriculture' directly represents the 'verticals' that VINES seeks to enable. The program requires innovations that span the user-edge-core-cloud continuum, and his work in Edge AI is central to this. Furthermore, his skills in 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' and 'Explainable AI (XAI)' can be framed to address the program's emphasis on network 'resilience' and trustworthiness. Expertise in 'LLMs' could be innovatively applied to network orchestration and management, while 'Watermarking techniques' could address security and data provenance in distributed NextG systems.
- **Research Domain Match:** The match is perfect. The researcher's domains of 'Computer Science', 'Engineering', and 'Machine Learning' are the foundational pillars of this call. The VINES program explicitly lists 'artificial_intelligence', 'cyberinfrastructure', and 'engineering_technology' as its key research areas, creating a direct one-to-one correspondence with the researcher's background.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's profile as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with a strong record of securing NSF SBIR funding is a significant advantage, especially for Track 2. SBIRs are focused on commercialization, mirroring the 'technology development, demonstration, and translation' focus of VINES Track 2. His success demonstrates an ability to bridge fundamental concepts with market-ready applications, a key goal of the VINES program in enhancing U.S. competitiveness. This experience in translation is a critical differentiator.
- **Innovation Potential:** High. The researcher can propose innovative solutions by integrating his distinct areas of expertise. For example, he could propose a framework for 'NextG Networks for Resilient Smart Manufacturing' that uses Edge AI and computer vision for real-time quality assurance, but with a novel focus on how the network itself dynamically allocates resources (e.g., bandwidth, latency guarantees) based on XAI-driven predictions of production line failures. Another innovative angle would be to use his watermarking expertise to create a secure and auditable trail for data moving from IoT sensors at the edge to the core cloud for training ML models, a critical need for trustworthy AI in regulated verticals.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the narrative from a device-centric 'On-Device AI' solution to a network-centric one. Frame the proposal around the question: 'What novel network architectures and intelligent management systems are required to support AutoML and on-device AI at massive scale for a specific vertical (e.g., predictive maintenance in factories)?' This reframes the existing work as a driving use-case that pushes the boundaries of network performance, resilience, and intelligence, directly addressing the VINES goals.
  - Reusable Elements: The core AutoML technology, problem formulation for a specific application, on-device implementation details, and the commercialization/translation plan which is a core component of SBIRs and VINES Track 2.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Elevate this proposal by explicitly integrating NextG networking concepts. The original PFI proposal likely focused on the algorithm and its translational potential. To adapt it for VINES, detail the specific network-layer innovations required. For instance, propose an 'intent-based networking' system where the asset monitoring application can request specific QoS (e.g., 'guaranteed low-latency for critical anomaly alerts') and the intelligent network autonomously configures itself to meet this need. This connects the application layer directly to the network systems layer.
  - Reusable Elements: The outlier detection algorithms, the 'Remote Asset Monitoring' vertical use case, the description of the end-user problem, and the partnership/translation framework inherent in a PFI proposal.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to target **Track 2: Verticals-Driven Technology Development**. The researcher's entrepreneurial background, SBIR success, and higher-TRL expertise are a perfect fit. The proposal should be framed around a single, compelling vertical like 'Smart Manufacturing' or 'Smart Agriculture'. He must build a team that includes a deep expert in network protocols/wireless systems to complement his AI/application expertise. Crucially, the proposal must include a strong industry partner from the chosen vertical who can provide a testbed and validate the 'adoption-ready' nature of the developed technology. The mandatory **Concept Outline (due 2025-08-25)** must be submitted, clearly articulating this vision and the strength of the team.

#### Success Factors
- **Form a Multi-Disciplinary Team:** The proposal's credibility hinges on a team that combines the researcher's AI/Edge/Vertical expertise with a Co-PI who has proven expertise in network systems, protocols (e.g., 5G/6G, TCP/IP), and network architecture.
- **Secure an End-User/Industry Partner:** For Track 2, demonstrating a clear path to translation is paramount. A letter of collaboration or co-PI from a company in the target vertical (e.g., a manufacturing firm) that will act as a testbed is essential.
- **Focus on Network Innovation:** The proposal must not solely describe a better AI application. It must clearly articulate the fundamental innovations in the network system itself (e.g., new protocols, new resource management algorithms, new security architectures) that are enabled by AI and are necessary to support the vertical.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **Demonstrating Network Systems Expertise:** The researcher's profile is heavily weighted towards AI applications that *use* a network. He must proactively address this potential gap by partnering with a networking expert to ensure the proposal addresses the full scope of the call, from the physical layer to the application layer.
- **Scope and Vision for a $6M Project:** Track 2 awards are substantial. The proposal must present a bold, transformative vision that justifies the budget. This will require a detailed, multi-year plan for development, demonstration on a real-world testbed, and a clear strategy for translation and standardization, going beyond a typical academic research project.

### 13. Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) (Score: 90)

**Program ID:** 505982  
**Compatibility Score:** 90/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is an excellent match for Dr. Reyes, whose entrepreneurial and translational research background aligns perfectly with POSE's mission, provided he can strategically pivot from his previous unsuccessful submission to focus explicitly on building a sustainable open-source organization rather than just the technology.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Reyes's technical expertise in high-impact areas like Machine Learning, Edge AI, IoT, and LLMs provides a strong foundation for the underlying open-source product required by the POSE program. Any of his projects, such as a toolkit for outlier detection, a framework for on-device AI, or watermarking techniques for LLMs, could serve as the core technology. The key is that the technology must already exist and show promise; the POSE proposal should not pitch its development, but rather the ecosystem to be built around it. His skills ensure the technological basis of a potential proposal would be credible and of national interest.
- **Research Domain Match:** The alignment is perfect. Dr. Reyes's domains of Computer Science and Engineering are central to the 'engineering_technology' and 'artificial_intelligence' areas listed for POSE. Furthermore, his application areas in Manufacturing Quality Assurance, Clean Energy, and Smart Agriculture directly address the program's emphasis on creating 'new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance.' This allows for a compelling narrative about the broader impacts of the proposed open-source ecosystem.
- **Experience Relevance:** This is Dr. Reyes's strongest asset. As a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with extensive success in NSF's translational programs (evidenced by multiple SBIR awards), he understands the 'Lab-to-Market' mindset that POSE extends to open-source. His experience with PFI proposals further strengthens this. Critically, his unsuccessful POSE proposal ('NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf') provides invaluable, albeit difficult, experience. He is not a novice to this specific program, which gives him an advantage if he can correctly diagnose and address the previous proposal's shortcomings.
- **Innovation Potential:** For POSE, innovation lies not in the core technology, but in the creation of a sustainable socio-technical ecosystem. Dr. Reyes's innovation potential is his ability to blend his entrepreneurial acumen with his technical depth. He can propose novel governance models, innovative community engagement strategies to convert users into contributors, or a unique sustainability plan that leverages industry partnerships—a concept familiar from his SBIR work. The innovation would be in the 'business plan' for the open-source ecosystem itself.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is the most critical asset. The strategy is not to reuse, but to fundamentally 'debug' this proposal. Dr. Reyes must perform a post-mortem, likely concluding it was too focused on the technology (Temporal Outlier Detection System?) and not enough on the OSE management. The new proposal must be rebuilt from the ground up to focus on: 1) A detailed governance plan (leadership structure, decision-making processes). 2) A community development strategy (how to onboard new contributors, code of conduct, communication channels). 3) A clear sustainability model (plans for funding/support after the grant ends). 4) Hard evidence of existing external users AND contributors, which may have been a weakness in the original.
  - Reusable Elements: The description of the core open-source product, its scientific merit, and its potential societal impact. Any preliminary data on the existing user base can be repurposed as the starting point for the ecosystem growth plan.
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal can be 'forked' from a commercialization path to an open-source one. The core technology, AutoML for On-Device AI, is a perfect candidate for an OSE. The strategy is to replace the commercialization plan with an ecosystem-building plan. The 'market' becomes the 'user and contributor community.' The 'business model' becomes the 'sustainability plan' (e.g., a consortium, foundation, or industry support). This reframing demonstrates a dual understanding of impact pathways.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical description of the product, its state-of-the-art nature, and its importance. The 'Commercial Opportunity' section can be re-written as the 'Societal Impact and Community Potential' section. The team's technical qualifications remain relevant.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy must be 'Ecosystem-First.' The proposal narrative should explicitly state that the technical work on the core product is largely complete and that this grant is sought to solve the socio-technical challenge of building a durable managing organization. Dr. Reyes should leverage his entrepreneurial background by structuring the proposal like a strategic plan for a non-profit foundation. He must clearly distinguish between a Phase I (scoping) and Phase II (establishment) proposal. Given the prompt's focus and his likely progress, a Phase II proposal requires concrete, verifiable evidence (e.g., screenshots of GitHub pull requests from external developers, forum discussions, a list of diverse contributors) to prove the ecosystem has already begun to form organically. If this evidence is weak, a stronger strategy would be to pursue a Phase I grant to formally develop the plan for a future Phase II.

#### Success Factors
- Explicitly addressing the POSE goal of funding the 'managing organization,' not the technology, in every section of the proposal.
- Providing robust, verifiable evidence of a pre-existing community that includes both external users and, critically for Phase II, unaffiliated external intellectual content developers.
- Presenting a detailed and credible 2-year plan for establishing OSE governance, infrastructure, and community management, along with a vision for long-term sustainability beyond the grant period.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Successfully diagnosing and overcoming the reasons for the previous POSE rejection ('NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf'). There is a significant risk of repeating past mistakes, such as focusing too much on technical roadmaps instead of community and governance structures.
- Meeting the high bar for a Phase II proposal. The solicitation requires a project that *already has* external contributors. If Dr. Reyes's project has many users but development is still centralized within his lab, the proposal will be seen as premature for Phase II and should be refocused as a Phase I.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This SBIR proposal likely details a specific, commercially-driven technology. To adapt it for FEC, the focus must shift from a single product to a broader capacity-building platform. The core technology (AutoML at the Edge) should be presented as a 'research thrust' or case study within a larger proposal to build an 'Interjurisdictional Center for Applied AI in Smart Manufacturing.' The proposal should describe how the FEC funding would build shared testbeds, forge new industry partnerships in multiple states, and create a joint talent pipeline to enable a whole class of similar use-inspired projects.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical approach, description of the core AI technology, the market/societal need analysis, and the discussion of commercialization pathways can be reused to establish a strong track record and demonstrate the potential impact of the proposed collaborative.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal should be framed as a strategic initiative to create a sustainable, multi-state research ecosystem. The narrative should position the researcher as the leader of a team that will bridge foundational AI research to industrial application. Key strategic elements should include: 1) A strong theme aligned with national priorities, such as 'AI for Resilient Supply Chains' or 'Intelligent Systems for Sustainable Agriculture'. 2) Leveraging his SBIR success as evidence of a proven model for translation. 3) Detailing the 'capacity-building' activities explicitly: new industry advisory boards, shared cyberinfrastructure, cross-institutional graduate curriculum, and a plan for long-term sustainability beyond the FEC award.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a Credible Interjurisdictional Team: The single most critical success factor is identifying and securing committed partners from other EPSCoR jurisdictions who bring complementary expertise (e.g., different foundational research, access to different industries) and a shared vision.
- Articulating a Clear Capacity-Building Vision: The proposal must convincingly argue that it is about building infrastructure, partnerships, and human capital for the long term, rather than just being a large, multi-investigator research project.
- Centering the 'Entrepreneurial' Mindset: The proposal should lean heavily on the researcher's unique 'academic entrepreneur' profile, using his past successes to validate his ability to lead a program focused on achieving real-world impact.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- EPSCoR Team Formation: The immediate and most significant hurdle is identifying and forming a genuine collaboration with researchers in other EPSCoR jurisdictions. This requires significant networking and effort before the Letter of Intent is due.
- Scaling from Project to Infrastructure Leadership: The researcher's experience appears to be in leading specific, product-oriented projects (SBIRs). He must demonstrate the vision and management plan required to lead a larger, multi-institutional infrastructure-building program, which involves more complex coordination and administration.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This supplemental request is not a new proposal but an addition to an existing award. The strategy is to leverage the core concepts of an active NSF award (hypothetically, one related to AutoML/On-Device AI) and frame the internship as a unique opportunity to validate and advance that research. The request should argue that placing a student at ARL or GVSC provides access to unique datasets, hardware platforms (e.g., tactical edge devices, ground vehicle prototypes), and operational challenges that are impossible to replicate in a university lab. This experience would directly feedback and enrich the parent grant's objectives.
  - Reusable Elements: From the parent grant's proposal, reuse the core technical approach, the problem statement, and the intellectual merit. These elements should be concisely summarized and then explicitly linked to a specific research problem at ARL/GVSC. For example, 'Our novel AutoML framework, developed under NSF award [Number], can be adapted to rapidly create and deploy anomaly detection models for the Army's ground vehicle fleet, a key research area at GVSC.'

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to demonstrate a clear win-win-win scenario. 1) The Student Wins: Gains invaluable hands-on experience, mentorship, and exposure to a potential career path. 2) The NSF Project Wins: The parent grant's research is advanced through application and validation in a real-world, high-impact setting. 3) The Army Wins: Gains access to a talented graduate student and cutting-edge academic research that addresses their specific needs.

This blend of foundational science and real-world application is a powerful combination for a competitive NSF proposal.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Refocus the proposal away from the partnership and commercialization-centric goals of the PFI program towards the fundamental research questions at its core. The central theme should shift from 'how can we build a product?' to 'what are the novel scientific principles and algorithmic breakthroughs needed for robust outlier detection in remote systems?'. Crucially, you must weave in the HBCU-EiR capacity-building narrative: detail how the project will establish a sustainable research lab, train a pipeline of undergraduate and graduate students, and position the PI to compete for a standard NSF CISE grant in the future.
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review, technical background on outlier detection, system architecture, and any preliminary data or methodologies can be repurposed as the core of the 'Intellectual Merit' section.
- **NIH LLMs.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the application domain from healthcare (NIH) to a domain central to NSF, such as engineering (e.g., LLMs for smart manufacturing), computer science (e.g., watermarking LLMs to protect IP, a direct link to his expertise), or clean energy (e.g., using LLMs to analyze energy grid data). The research questions should be foundational, addressing challenges like LLM efficiency for Edge AI, trustworthiness, or explainability. The budget should be reconfigured to fit the NSF-EiR award size and can include a request for instrumentation (up to 30%) to build the necessary computational infrastructure at the HBCU.
  - Reusable Elements: The fundamental concepts and literature review on Large Language Models can serve as a strong starting point. The core architectural ideas can be adapted to the new, NSF-relevant application domain.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to fully embrace the spirit of the HBCU-EiR program. The proposal must be explicitly framed as a 'capacity-building' project. The narrative should clearly state how this award will be the catalyst that allows the PI to build a research group and infrastructure capable of competing for standard NSF R&RA grants (e.g., a CISE CAREER award or a core program grant) in 3-5 years. De-emphasize immediate commercialization in the project description and focus on the generation of new knowledge, while using the potential for commercialization as a compelling 'Broader Impact'. The most critical step is to identify the target NSF core program (the 'secondary unit of consideration') and contact that program officer well in advance of the LOI deadline to discuss the project idea and ensure alignment.

#### Success Factors
- Explicitly addressing the 'sustainable improvement in research capacity' goal of the solicitation, detailing mentorship plans for students and postdocs, and explaining how the project will enhance the institution's research infrastructure.
- Carefully selecting the most appropriate 'secondary unit of consideration' within an NSF Directorate like CISE and establishing contact with the Program Officer of that unit to refine the research idea and demonstrate proactive engagement.
- Successfully reframing his extensive applied research and SBIR experience into a compelling narrative about fundamental research questions, focusing the proposal on 'Intellectual Merit' over immediate commercial prospects.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Institutional Eligibility: The researcher's profile does not specify his institutional affiliation. This program is strictly limited to accredited Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). If he is not a full-time faculty member or researcher at an HBCU, he is ineligible, and the compatibility score is 0.
- Mindset and Framing Shift: The researcher's documented success is in the NSF SBIR program, which requires a commercialization-focused, product-oriented narrative. He must consciously shift his grant-writing style to align with a fundamental research (R&RA) proposal, which prioritizes the creation of new knowledge and addressing scientific gaps.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf / NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is a supplemental request, not a full proposal, so adaptation is about narrative framing. The core strategy is to extract the 'Commercial Opportunity' and 'Broader Impacts' sections from his successful SBIR proposals. These sections already articulate a compelling business case and societal need, which can be reframed to explain why an internship at a non-academic entity is a critical step in the research-to-impact pathway for a graduate student.
  - Reusable Elements: Reuse the description of the core technology, the market analysis justifying the need for the technology, and the description of potential commercial partners. These elements can be repurposed to build the 'Internship Plan' section, clearly defining the research project the student will undertake at the host organization and explaining its relevance.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to leverage Dr. Reyes's entrepreneurial profile. The supplemental request (typically a 2-5 page document) should be framed not just as a student opportunity, but as a strategic partnership that accelerates technology translation. Key steps:
1. **Confirm Eligibility:** The absolute first step is to verify he is the PI on an active NSF award at an academic institution (not an SBIR/STTR award to his company) and that the award's directorate participates (e.g., ENG, or CISE if the award is from OAC).
2. **Leverage Network:** Identify a host organization from his existing industry contacts.
3. **Develop a Co-Mentorship Plan:** Craft a clear plan detailing his role and the role of the host organization mentor. Highlight the unique skills the student will gain (e.g., project management, corporate communication, IP strategy) that are unavailable in the lab.
4. **Contact the Program Officer:** Follow the DCL's strong recommendation to discuss the plan with the cognizant NSF Program Director for the parent award before submission.

#### Success Factors
- **The PI's Hybrid Profile:** Dr. Reyes's demonstrated expertise in both academic research and entrepreneurship makes him a uniquely credible applicant for a program designed to bridge this exact gap.
- **Strong Industry Relevance:** The alignment of his research with in-demand industry needs makes it easy to formulate a compelling and impactful internship project.

Dr. Reyes' domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are central to the NSF CISE directorate, which houses the III program. The program explicitly calls for research that leverages properties of specific application domains, including 'health, education, science, or engineering.' Dr. Reyes' experience in Manufacturing Quality Assurance (engineering), Smart Agriculture (science/engineering), and his past proposals in health (NIH attempts) demonstrate a perfect fit with these target application areas.
- **Experience Relevance:** Dr. Reyes' track record of securing over $1.2M in funding, primarily through NSF SBIR grants, demonstrates significant project management capability and the ability to deliver on proposed work. This history of success, particularly with the NSF, is a major asset. However, the III program is a *core research* program, not a commercialization-focused one like SBIR. Therefore, while his experience is highly relevant, he must adapt his proposal style to emphasize foundational scientific contributions, theoretical advancements, and generalizable methods over product development and market potential. His unsuccessful proposals in other non-SBIR NSF programs (PFI, POSE) provide valuable learning experiences for this transition.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for an innovative proposal is extremely high by synthesizing Dr. Reyes' diverse skill set. A project combining Edge AI for efficient data processing in IoT networks with novel, explainable LLM-based methods for real-time anomaly detection would be highly innovative. Another avenue is developing new watermarking techniques not just for static digital assets but for dynamic knowledge bases or the outputs of generative AI models, directly addressing the III program's interests in provenance, security, and knowledge management in novel ways. His entrepreneurial background can be framed as a unique ability to identify research problems with high societal and economic impact, which is a key goal of the program.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Shift the proposal's core focus from the PFI (Partnerships for Innovation) goal of technology translation to the III program's goal of creating fundamental knowledge. De-emphasize the commercial partner and go-to-market strategy. Instead, abstract the problem to 'novel computational methods for scalable, real-time outlier detection in distributed, heterogeneous data streams.' Frame the remote asset monitoring as a compelling, high-impact testbed that drives and validates the fundamental research, rather than the end-goal itself.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement, literature review on outlier detection and IoT monitoring, the core technical approach for the detection algorithms, and any preliminary system architecture or results can be directly reused and expanded upon.
- **RecommendationSystem-NSF21_PFI_Auto_GNN_2.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Reframe the work to address fundamental challenges in 'Data management' and 'Advanced analytics' for graph data. The innovation should not be the 'AutoML' aspect, but rather the novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture or the methods for handling dynamic, large-scale graph data for knowledge extraction. The proposal could explore questions like: 'How can GNNs be adapted for streaming data with evolving schemas?' or 'What are novel methods for ensuring fairness and explainability in GNN-based recommender systems?' This aligns directly with III's interest in knowledge extraction, advanced analytics, and data representations.
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review on GNNs and recommender systems, the core GNN architecture concepts, and the proposed evaluation metrics can serve as a strong foundation for a new, research-focused proposal.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to propose a project that synthesizes multiple areas of expertise and explicitly addresses the 'full data lifecycle' mentioned in the synopsis. A compelling proposal would be 'Foundations of Explainable and Secure Anomaly Detection in Federated Edge AI Systems.' This narrative leverages IoT/Edge AI (acquisition/management), Anomaly Detection (analysis), XAI (explanation), and watermarking concepts (security/provenance). Grounding this research in a specific, high-impact domain like Smart Agriculture or Clean Energy infrastructure monitoring will demonstrate the 'societal importance' sought by the III program, using his entrepreneurial acumen to identify a relevant problem without making it a commercial pitch.

#### Success Factors
- Clearly articulating the fundamental research questions and the novel, generalizable computational methods being developed, distinguishing the work from past commercialization-focused SBIR proposals.
- Leveraging a compelling application domain (e.g., Smart Agriculture, Manufacturing QA) as a testbed to validate the research and demonstrate broader impact, as explicitly encouraged by the solicitation.
- Proposing a synergistic project that integrates multiple areas of his unique expertise (e.g., XAI + Anomaly Detection + Edge AI) to create a highly innovative and differentiated research plan.
- Highlighting how the proposed research addresses multiple facets of the data lifecycle described in the III synopsis, from acquisition and management to analysis and explanation.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Transitioning Proposal Framing: The primary challenge is shifting the narrative from the product- and market-oriented framing of an SBIR proposal to the fundamental knowledge and scientific contribution framing required for a core NSF research program. The proposal must be reviewed by academics, not VCs.
- Demonstrating Foundational Research Credentials: While his expertise is evident, the provided successful proposals are all from the SBIR program. The proposal should be bolstered by citing peer-reviewed publications in top-tier academic journals and conferences to firmly establish his credentials as a fundamental researcher to the review panel.

**Summary:** This is an excellent match due to the researcher's deep expertise in AI and security, extensive experience with translational NSF funding, and a highly relevant past proposal for the precursor POSE program, provided he can frame his work around a specific open-source ecosystem.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Costilla Reyes's technical expertise aligns exceptionally well with the Safe-OSE program's focus. His skills in 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' are fundamental to identifying security threats like malicious code commits or network intrusions within an OSE. His work with 'LLMs' and 'Watermarking techniques' can be directly applied to secure AI models as OSEs, addressing threats like model inversion, data poisoning, or intellectual property theft. Furthermore, his expertise in 'Explainable AI (XAI)' directly addresses the 'safety' component of the call by enabling transparent, auditable, and trustworthy AI-based ecosystems. This combination allows for a sophisticated proposal that can address both traditional code vulnerabilities and emerging threats in AI/ML-based open-source projects.
- **Research Domain Match:** The alignment is perfect. The opportunity explicitly lists 'artificial_intelligence', 'cybersecurity', and 'cyberinfrastructure' as key research areas. These are the core of Dr. Costilla Reyes's research domains and technical expertise. His applied work in Manufacturing, IoT, and Smart Agriculture can serve as powerful, high-impact case studies for an OSE that requires enhanced security, grounding the proposal in real-world needs and broadening its potential impact.
- **Experience Relevance:** His experience is a significant asset. As a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with a strong record in securing NSF SBIR funding, he has proven his ability to frame research in terms of practical, tangible outcomes, which is the goal of the Safe-OSE program ('catalyze meaningful improvements'). The most critical piece of experience is his unsuccessful proposal for the 'NSF22_POSE' program. Since POSE is the direct precursor to Safe-OSE, this indicates he has already developed the concept for an open-source ecosystem, which is a prerequisite for this call. This prior work, though unfunded, provides an invaluable foundation and a compelling narrative of progress.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is high, stemming from the unique fusion of his skills. Dr. Costilla Reyes can propose novel, AI-driven solutions to OSE security that go beyond static analysis. For instance, he could propose using LLMs to detect sophisticated social engineering attacks within community discussions and pull requests, or develop a framework using XAI to continuously audit the fairness and safety of an open-source machine learning model. Another innovative angle is the application of his digital watermarking techniques to ensure the provenance and integrity of open-source datasets and models, a critical socio-technical challenge in the AI supply chain.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is the most valuable asset. The strategy is to pivot the narrative from the POSE goal (establishing an OSE) to the Safe-OSE goal (securing an OSE). Frame the original OSE concept from this proposal as now existing but facing critical security/safety/privacy vulnerabilities that hinder its growth and adoption. The proposal should detail these specific vulnerabilities and propose a concrete plan to use the Safe-OSE funds to implement technical and socio-technical solutions to mitigate them. It's crucial to analyze and address the reviewer feedback from the POSE submission.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire description of the Open-Source Ecosystem (its purpose, target community, technical foundation, governance structure), the team's qualifications, and the broader impact statement can be reused and updated.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Take the core anomaly detection technology described in this proposal and frame it as a targeted security tool for a well-defined OSE. Instead of a generic PFI proposal, this would become 'An Anomaly Detection Framework to Secure the [Specific OSE, e.g., 'Home Assistant' or 'PX4 Autopilot'] Supply Chain'. This approach requires identifying and potentially partnering with an existing OSE to demonstrate need and a clear path to integration.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections describing the outlier detection algorithms, the system architecture, and the evaluation metrics can be directly repurposed.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy should be to present this proposal as the logical and necessary evolution of his prior work on the POSE proposal. He should explicitly reference the foundational work done for the OSE and argue that securing it is the critical next step for its survival and impact. The proposal should be heavily themed around 'AI-for-OSE-Security,' leveraging his unique expertise to differentiate it. He must emphasize how his solutions address both technical code vulnerabilities and complex socio-technical issues like insider threats or supply chain integrity, a key focus of the solicitation. Partnering with a user facility or an established open-source project that would integrate his proposed security enhancements would significantly strengthen the proposal's credibility and impact.

#### Success Factors
- Clearly defining the target Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) and providing evidence of its current security, safety, or privacy gaps. This is the central requirement of the call.
- Building a compelling narrative that leverages the prior NSF POSE proposal, showing a mature understanding of the ecosystem's needs and a progression of thought from creation to security.
- Proposing novel security solutions that uniquely leverage his expertise at the intersection of AI, XAI, and watermarking, demonstrating a clear innovative contribution beyond standard security practices.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The proposal's success is entirely contingent on having a credible OSE to focus on. If the OSE from the 'NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf' proposal is not sufficiently active or established, he must either rapidly mature it or form a strong partnership with an existing OSE.
- Shifting from a product-centric (SBIR) or tech-transfer (PFI) mindset to an ecosystem-support mindset. The proposal must focus on building sustainable security capabilities, processes, and community knowledge within the OSE, not just delivering a standalone tool, which aligns with the 'Cooperative Agreement' nature of the award.

His skills in 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)', 'Computer Vision in Manufacturing', 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection', and 'Manufacturing Quality Assurance' form the foundation of an intelligent, autonomous manufacturing system. Furthermore, his expertise in 'IoT', 'Low-power electronics', and 'Energy Harvesting Systems' can be combined to propose a truly novel manufacturing paradigm: decentralized, self-powered, and resilient micro-factories. His work on 'Watermarking techniques' and 'Digital IP Protection' introduces a unique and critical angle for future distributed manufacturing ecosystems, addressing the challenge of protecting proprietary designs in a 'manufacturing-as-a-service' world. This combination moves beyond simple process optimization and into the realm of creating fundamentally new, intelligent manufacturing capabilities.
- **Research Domain Match:** The alignment is very strong. Dr. Reyes's primary domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are central to the FM program's listed Research Areas, particularly 'artificial_intelligence', 'engineering_technology', 'cyberinfrastructure', and 'cybersecurity'. His ancillary interests in 'Clean Energy' and 'Smart Agriculture' also map directly onto the solicitation's emphasis on addressing societal challenges like 'climate change' and 'environmental sustainability'. He can credibly frame his research to address these broader impacts, which is a key requirement.
- **Experience Relevance:** Dr. Reyes's profile as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with a substantial funding record ($1.2M+) is a significant asset. His success with NSF SBIR proposals (as indicated by filenames) demonstrates a proven ability to frame research in terms of tangible outcomes and economic impact, which is a core tenet of the FM program's goal to 'catalyze new manufacturing capabilities' and 'seed nascent future industries'. This entrepreneurial background suggests he can effectively articulate a vision for how fundamental research can translate into a new manufacturing ecosystem, a perspective that is highly valued in programs like this.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for a highly innovative proposal is substantial. Instead of proposing to improve an existing factory line with AI, Dr. Reyes could propose the fundamental research to create a network of autonomous, self-powered, containerized manufacturing pods. This concept would leverage Edge AI for on-site quality control, energy harvesting for off-grid operation (addressing infrastructure deficits), computer vision for process monitoring, and digital watermarking to ensure IP-protected, on-demand fabrication. This is the kind of 'potentially transformative' and 'nascent future industry' concept that the FM solicitation explicitly calls for, moving far beyond incremental improvements.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF23_SBIR_ph2_ProjectDescription.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Elevate the core technology from a specific commercial product (the focus of an SBIR) to a foundational manufacturing capability. The central theme must shift from 'here is a product that uses AI for QA' to 'here is the fundamental research to create a new class of self-correcting manufacturing processes enabled by explainable AI.' The commercialization plan from the SBIR should be transformed into a broader 'Ecosystem and Workforce Development Plan' for the FM proposal.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical architecture, description of the AI/ML models, preliminary data, and the state-of-the-art analysis can be heavily reused. The discussion of market need can be reframed as a discussion of societal challenges. The team's expertise and biographical sketches are directly portable.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal's core idea of remote monitoring can be adapted to be the 'nervous system' for a future manufacturing network. Frame it not as monitoring existing assets, but as the enabling technology for fleets of future autonomous manufacturing systems, ensuring their reliability and performance. This aligns with creating new capabilities rather than servicing old ones.
  - Reusable Elements: The algorithms for outlier detection, the data communication strategy (likely IoT-focused), and the technical justification for remote monitoring can be repurposed as a foundational component of the new manufacturing system being proposed.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy must be to explicitly and repeatedly address the 'transformative' nature of the proposed research. The proposal should be structured around a grand vision, such as 'Pioneering Autonomous, Sustainable, and Democratized Manufacturing.' Every section, from the technical approach to the workforce development plan, must tie back to this vision. He should leverage his entrepreneurial background to project a credible pathway from research to a new industry, fulfilling the program's goal. Critically, the proposal must have a deeply integrated and robust 'Plan to equip students and upskill the workforce,' potentially by proposing a curriculum or training module on 'AI for Future Industrial Systems' that complements the research activities.

#### Success Factors
- The unique synthesis of high-demand technical skills: Edge AI, IoT, computer vision, and digital IP protection, which together can form a compelling, novel manufacturing concept.
- Demonstrated success with applied research funding (SBIR), which indicates an ability to connect research to real-world impact and economic development, a key goal of the FM program.
- The 'Academic Entrepreneur' persona is a perfect fit for a program aiming to 'seed nascent future industries' and bridge the gap between fundamental research and new economic opportunities.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Avoiding the 'Incremental Improvement' Trap: Dr. Reyes's background in QA and SBIRs could naturally lead to a proposal focused on 'making current manufacturing better.' He must consciously and deliberately pivot to frame his work as 'creating a new way to manufacture altogether.' The proposal will be rejected if it reads like an improvement to an existing factory.
- Developing a Compelling Education & Workforce Plan: The solicitation places a heavy emphasis on a co-equal education and workforce development plan. Dr. Reyes's submitted proposal titles suggest a strong focus on technology and business. He may need to partner with a colleague from a College of Education or a social scientist specializing in workforce training to develop a plan that is as innovative and detailed as the technical research plan.

### 23. Manufacturing Systems Integration (MSI) (Score: 88)

**Program ID:** 505941  
**Compatibility Score:** 88/100  
**Summary:** This is an excellent match based on technical expertise, but the researcher must strategically pivot from his successful applied/SBIR background to a fundamental research focus on generalizable principles to align with this core NSF program.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise aligns exceptionally well with the core themes of the MSI program. His skills in 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection', 'Manufacturing Quality Assurance', and 'Computer Vision in Manufacturing' directly address the need for intelligent production systems. His expertise in 'LLMs', 'IoT', 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)', and 'Explainable AI (XAI)' provides a powerful toolkit to tackle challenges in 'Intelligent self-organizing production systems' and 'seamless integration of technologies, machines, and humans'. Furthermore, his unique expertise in 'Watermarking techniques for digital asset protection' is a perfect and novel fit for the program's emphasis on 'Digital representation, protocols', and 'Reliable and secure communications within and across the manufacturing value chain'.
- **Research Domain Match:** The alignment is perfect. The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are the exact interdisciplinary triad the MSI program seeks. The solicitation explicitly welcomes 'Interdisciplinary, convergent proposals that bring diverse perspectives,' and the researcher's profile embodies this convergence. He is well-positioned to bridge the gap between computational methods (LLMs, AI) and physical manufacturing systems (IoT, quality assurance).
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's experience as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with over $1.2M in funding is a significant strength, demonstrating an ability to secure competitive grants. His successful NSF SBIR proposals (e.g., 'NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf') are highly relevant in their technical content. However, this experience is also a potential risk. The MSI program is a fundamental research program, not a commercialization-focused one like SBIR. The researcher must demonstrate that he can frame his work around foundational scientific questions rather than product development. His unsuccessful proposals in programs like NSF PFI and POSE show he has experience writing for different types of programs, which is valuable learning.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is extremely high. The researcher can propose a novel framework that integrates several cutting-edge areas. For instance, he could propose foundational research on using LLMs to generate and optimize manufacturing process plans, deploying these plans on Edge AI-enabled IoT devices for real-time control and anomaly detection, and using novel watermarking techniques to embed provenance, security, and IP data directly into the digital thread and even the physical products. This approach directly addresses the MSI goals of integration, intelligence, security, and creating generalizable, verifiable digital manufacturing ecosystems.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technical idea of using AutoML on edge devices must be abstracted from a product-centric pitch to a fundamental research question. Instead of 'developing a tool for on-device AI,' the proposal should be framed as 'investigating the fundamental principles of self-organizing, decentralized production systems enabled by AutoML, and developing generalizable models for their implementation and validation.' The focus must shift from the 'what' (the product) to the 'how' and 'why' (the underlying science).
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review on AI in manufacturing, technical descriptions of the AutoML and Edge AI components, and preliminary system architecture diagrams can be repurposed. The 'Intellectual Merit' section can be expanded, while the 'Commercialization Plan' must be completely replaced with a robust 'Broader Impacts' section focusing on workforce development, open data/models, and dissemination in academic venues.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful PFI proposal is a valuable asset because PFI bridges fundamental and applied research. The researcher should analyze why it was unsuccessful, likely because the fundamental research questions were not deep enough or the commercial plan was not strong enough. For the MSI program, he should strip out the commercial aspects and significantly deepen the fundamental research questions around outlier detection in distributed, heterogeneous manufacturing systems. For example, 'What new data representation protocols are needed to enable generalizable outlier detection across legacy and modern equipment?'
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement regarding remote asset monitoring, the data challenges identified, and the technical approach for outlier detection can serve as a strong foundation. These elements should be recast to address a general class of manufacturing systems, not a specific application.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to frame the proposal around the unique intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs), Edge AI, and Digital Watermarking as a solution for secure, intelligent, and integrated manufacturing systems. He should highlight his 'Digital IP Protection' expertise as a key differentiator that addresses the critical and often overlooked need for trust and security in the digital thread. The proposal narrative must consistently use the language of the solicitation, focusing on 'fundamental research,' 'generalizable principles,' and 'integration across the life cycle.' Crucially, he must follow the program's explicit advice to contact an MSI program director to vet his research idea, positioning it as 'Foundational research into secure, self-organizing manufacturing systems using watermarked, LLM-generated process models.'

#### Success Factors
- Clearly framing the research to address fundamental scientific questions about manufacturing systems integration, avoiding the language and focus of a commercial product pitch.
- Leveraging the novel combination of LLMs for process generation and watermarking for security/provenance as a powerful, innovative hook that directly aligns with the program's goals.
- Proactively contacting the MSI Program Director to discuss the research idea, demonstrating commitment and ensuring the proposal is well-aligned with the program's current vision and portfolio.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Overcoming Reviewer Bias: Given the researcher's strong SBIR background, reviewers may be skeptical of his commitment to fundamental research. The proposal must be exceptionally clear in its scientific hypotheses and research questions to counteract this potential bias.
- Demonstrating Generalizability: The researcher must ensure his proposed work is not tied to a single manufacturing process or industry. The proposal needs to explicitly describe how the developed models, protocols, and principles will be generalizable and applicable to a wide range of manufacturing systems, including those with legacy equipment.

His experience in technology commercialization and IP protection provides a strong foundation for crafting a credible, long-term sustainability plan, a key evaluation criterion for this program. His unsuccessful attempts at related programs like POSE and PFI indicate he is already thinking along the right lines of building community-focused, sustainable platforms.
- **Innovation Potential:** The innovation lies in integrating cutting-edge AI/ML components (Edge AI, XAI, LLMs) into a cohesive, user-friendly cyberinfrastructure *service* for a specific research community. Instead of researchers in fields like agriculture or manufacturing having to build their own data pipelines and ML models, Dr. Reyes can propose a framework that democratizes access to these advanced tools. The innovation is not just the AI algorithm, but the creation of a scalable, reusable platform that accelerates scientific discovery for a broad, interdisciplinary group of users.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the core technology from a commercial product (SBIR focus) to a community research platform (CSSI focus). The narrative should shift from 'selling a tool' to 'providing a service that enables other NSF-funded researchers'. Frame the AutoML/On-Device AI system as a foundational 'Element' (the most suitable award class) that other scientists can use to deploy their own models for various research applications without needing deep AI expertise. The 'Commercialization Plan' should be repurposed into a 'Sustainability Plan' that outlines a path to community governance, user fees, or an open-source foundation model.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical description of the AutoML and On-Device AI system, the literature review/state-of-the-art, preliminary data, and system architecture can be reused. The 'Broader Impacts' section can be expanded to focus on community building, training workshops, and enabling interdisciplinary research.

**Strategic Positioning:** Propose an 'Elements' award to create a 'Cyberinfrastructure for AI-driven Anomaly Detection in Smart Environments' (e.g., agriculture or manufacturing). The strategy must be built around a specific scientific community. The proposal should include strong letters of collaboration from researchers in that target domain (e.g., plant scientists, materials engineers) who explicitly state how this CI would solve their current data challenges and accelerate their work. Emphasize the 'quantitative metrics' by defining targets for community adoption, number of datasets processed, and new scientific publications enabled by the platform.

#### Success Factors
- Forming strong, interdisciplinary partnerships with a target scientific community and embedding their needs and feedback directly into the proposal.
- Clearly articulating a multi-faceted sustainability plan that leverages the PI's entrepreneurial experience, going beyond simple open-sourcing to include community management, user support, and potential future funding models.
- Framing the proposal as a service-oriented infrastructure that lowers the barrier to entry for advanced AI in a specific scientific field, thereby amplifying the impact of other NSF investments.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Transitioning the narrative from the product-centric focus of SBIR proposals to the community-centric, service-oriented focus required by CSSI. This requires a fundamental shift in perspective from 'customer' to 'user community'.
- Identifying and securing formal commitments from a well-defined research community. The proposal cannot be speculative; it must demonstrate existing demand and have credible collaborators who will be the initial users and champions of the cyberinfrastructure.

**Compatibility Score:** 88/100  
**Summary:** This is a very strong match due to the researcher's direct expertise in AI, IoT, and computer vision for manufacturing quality assurance, aligning perfectly with the program's focus on cybermanufacturing, though proposals must be framed around fundamental research rather than commercialization.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Costilla Reyes's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned with the Advanced Manufacturing program's goals. His skills in 'Manufacturing Quality Assurance', 'Computer Vision in Manufacturing', 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection', and 'Explainable AI (XAI)' directly address the program's interest in transforming manufacturing methods and practices. His work in 'IoT', 'Low-power electronics', and 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)' is core to the development of 'cybermanufacturing systems', a key area highlighted in the synopsis. Furthermore, his expertise in 'Watermarking techniques' and 'Digital IP Protection' can be framed as a novel contribution to securing the digital thread in distributed manufacturing environments, addressing the program's interest in national security.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are an ideal combination for this opportunity. The AM program explicitly welcomes 'interdisciplinary, convergent proposals' that 'transcend and cross domain boundaries.' Dr. Costilla Reyes's profile embodies this convergence, bringing cutting-edge computational approaches (AI/ML) to solve fundamental challenges in the engineering domain of manufacturing. This positions him perfectly to propose research that 'fundamentally alters and transforms manufacturing capabilities' as requested by the program.
- **Experience Relevance:** With over $1.2M in funding and 7 successful proposals, Dr. Costilla Reyes has a proven track record. His experience as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' and his success with NSF SBIR grants are highly relevant to the program's goal of fostering 'national prosperity'. This experience demonstrates an ability to connect research to real-world impact. However, a key distinction is that the AM program funds fundamental research, not commercialization-focused projects like SBIRs. He must leverage his experience to inform the 'Broader Impacts' of his fundamental research, rather than making commercialization the central theme.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. Dr. Costilla Reyes can propose transformative research by combining his advanced AI expertise with manufacturing challenges. For example, he could propose: 1) Developing novel, XAI-driven anomaly detection systems that not only identify defects but also diagnose root causes in complex supply chains. 2) Creating new frameworks for using Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize manufacturing process plans or to enable natural language interaction with factory robotics. 3) Designing foundational Edge AI algorithms for ultra-low-power, real-time quality control directly on manufacturing machines, a significant leap beyond current cloud-based systems.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot from the commercialization-centric SBIR framework to a fundamental research focus. The core research question should shift from 'How can we build a product using on-device AutoML?' to 'What are the fundamental principles and theoretical limits of using AutoML to generate robust, resource-aware AI models for dynamic manufacturing environments?' The work should focus on creating new knowledge and generalizable methods, not just a specific application.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical background on AutoML, the literature review on Edge AI, descriptions of the core algorithms, and preliminary results demonstrating feasibility can be directly reused. The 'Commercialization Plan' section should be repurposed into a powerful 'Broader Impacts' statement.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful PFI proposal is a prime candidate for adaptation. The core idea is strong, but it may have failed due to PFI's specific partnership requirements or a perceived lack of fundamental research. Reframe it for the AM program by focusing on the novelty of the outlier detection algorithms themselves. Propose a new class of algorithms specifically designed for the high-dimensionality, multi-modal sensor data found in advanced manufacturing systems. The application (remote asset monitoring) becomes the validation testbed for the fundamental research, not the primary goal.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement, literature review on anomaly detection, and the proposed technical approach are likely reusable. The focus needs to be elevated from a specific solution to a generalizable scientific contribution.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal should be positioned as a 'convergent research' project at the intersection of AI, cyberinfrastructure, and manufacturing engineering. Explicitly use the program's language, such as 'transformative methodologies' and 'cybermanufacturing systems'. To significantly strengthen the proposal, Dr. Costilla Reyes should partner with a co-PI from a traditional manufacturing discipline (e.g., mechanical engineering, materials science) who can provide domain-specific challenges and a physical testbed. The narrative should clearly articulate how this interdisciplinary team will advance fundamental knowledge that revitalizes American manufacturing.

#### Success Factors
- The powerful synergy between the researcher's AI/ML/IoT expertise and the explicit needs of the 'cybermanufacturing' thrust within the AM program.
- The entrepreneurial background, which provides a credible and compelling narrative for the 'Broader Impacts' criterion by connecting fundamental research to national prosperity.
- The opportunity to frame the work as 'convergent research', which is explicitly encouraged by the solicitation and is a hallmark of Dr. Costilla Reyes's profile.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Shifting Narrative from Applied to Fundamental: The researcher's proposal history is heavily weighted towards applied (SBIR) and translational (PFI) programs. He must demonstrate the ability to frame a compelling proposal around fundamental scientific questions, where the primary output is new knowledge, not a product or commercial plan.
- Potential Collaboration Gap: The profile does not indicate existing collaborations with experts in traditional manufacturing disciplines.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technical concept of enabling complex AI on resource-constrained devices is perfect for CSR. The adaptation strategy is to completely reframe the project from a commercial product to a fundamental research investigation. He must strip out all SBIR-specific components (Market Opportunity, Company/Team, Commercialization Plan) and radically expand the technical section. Instead of proposing to 'build a tool', he should propose to 'investigate the fundamental principles and trade-offs governing automated neural architecture search on heterogeneous, energy-harvesting edge devices'. The goal should shift from creating a product to creating new knowledge, models, and design principles for the entire field.
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review on Edge AI and low-power ML, the technical background on AutoML, the preliminary system architecture, and any performance data on existing hardware can be directly reused as the foundation and preliminary results for the new, research-focused proposal.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to leverage his entrepreneurial experience as a means of identifying critical, real-world research challenges, but to frame the proposal purely around foundational science and engineering. The proposal title and narrative should explicitly target 'fundamental trade-offs', 'novel system architectures', or 'new hardware-software co-design principles'. He should structure the proposal around the core pillars mentioned in the synopsis: performance, energy-efficiency, sustainability, security, and privacy. Highlighting his unique combination of expertise in Edge AI, low-power hardware, and security (watermarking) will position the proposal as uniquely innovative and directly responsive to the call for 'clean-slate approaches'.

#### Success Factors

The business-focused sections should be replaced with a robust 'Broader Impacts' section focusing on the scientific community.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Adapt the anomaly detection framework from 'remote asset monitoring' in an industrial context to 'real-time security and integrity monitoring of scientific cyberinfrastructure'. A strong use case would be securing a large-scale environmental sensor network or monitoring the operational integrity of a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster's file system. This would be a strong fit for the TCR program area, focusing on transitioning a proven technique to a new, critical scientific environment.
  - Reusable Elements: The machine learning models for outlier/anomaly detection, the system architecture for data ingestion and real-time analysis, and performance evaluation metrics. The 'customer discovery' from the PFI could be repurposed as 'stakeholder engagement' with a specific scientific CI community.

**Strategic Positioning:** The strongest strategy is to target the 'Integrity, Provenance, and Authenticity for Artificial Intelligence Ready Data (IPAAI)' track. The proposal narrative should be: 'Securing the AI for Science Revolution: A Novel Framework for Verifiable Provenance and Integrity in Large-Scale Scientific Datasets using Explainable Watermarking'. Success is contingent on forming a genuine collaboration with two key groups: 1) Domain scientists (e.g., climatologists, biologists) who produce and use large datasets and can articulate the scientific need. 2) Cyberinfrastructure professionals (e.g., from a campus or national supercomputing center) who can help ground the proposed solution in the realities of a production CI environment. This multi-stakeholder approach is critical for CICI.

#### Success Factors
- The unique and powerful combination of expertise in watermarking, AI/LLMs, and XAI is a perfect technical match for the cutting-edge IPAAI track.
- Proven experience in transitioning technology from research to application (evidenced by SBIR/PFI proposals) aligns with the CICI program's goal of deploying real-world solutions.
- The researcher's entrepreneurial background suggests an ability to identify critical problems and build practical, impactful solutions, which is a key differentiator.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Lack of explicit, documented experience with large-scale, non-commercial *scientific* cyberinfrastructure (e.g., HPC centers, national research networks). This must be mitigated by securing committed, senior-level partners from such an environment.
- The need to shift the proposal's central motivation and impact narrative from commercialization (SBIR/PFI focus) to enabling and securing open scientific discovery, which is the core mission of CICI and the NSF.

His 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' status and success with NSF SBIR grants demonstrate a proven ability to connect research to real-world impact and commercialization. While this is a major strength for the 'Broader Impacts' criterion, he must be careful to frame his SaTC proposal around foundational research questions rather than a commercial product. His experience with the NSF ecosystem is a significant advantage.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The intersection of LLMs, XAI, IoT, and security is a frontier research area. The researcher can propose 'clean-slate' approaches to building trustworthy AI systems from the ground up, a concept explicitly encouraged by the solicitation. For example, he could propose novel watermarking techniques for generative AI to combat disinformation or develop new XAI-driven anomaly detection methods that allow human operators to trust and verify security alerts in critical infrastructure. His entrepreneurial mindset can also lead to innovative 'Transition to Practice' plans.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful PFI proposal is the best foundation. Reframe the project from the PFI 'technology transfer' lens to the SaTC 'foundational research' lens. The core topic, 'Outlier Detection for Remote Asset Monitoring,' is a perfect fit. The adaptation should focus on the fundamental scientific challenges: How do we build *trustworthy* and *resilient* monitoring systems in the face of sophisticated adversaries? How does Explainable AI (XAI) impact an operator's trust and response time? This requires adding a strong collaborator from social/behavioral sciences to study the human-trust-in-automation aspect.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical background on outlier detection algorithms, the literature review on remote asset monitoring, the description of the target IoT/cyber-physical system environment, and the preliminary data or system architecture can all be reused and expanded upon.
- **NIH LLMs.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Adapt the core concepts from this unsuccessful proposal by shifting the application domain from specific NIH health goals to the broad security, privacy, and trust challenges of LLMs that SaTC addresses. Propose research on topics like: 1) watermarking LLM-generated content to trace its origin and combat misinformation; 2) developing privacy-preserving training and fine-tuning techniques for LLMs; or 3) creating methods to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks like prompt injection and data poisoning. This aligns perfectly with building confidence in next-generation cyber systems.
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review on LLM architectures, the technical description of model mechanics, and the discussion of ethical risks can be repurposed. The focus would need to shift from clinical applications to cybersecurity principles.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to submit a 'RES: Research' proposal with a budget exceeding $600,000. The proposal title and abstract must explicitly use the word 'Trust'. The core idea should fuse a technical innovation (e.g., 'Explainable Anomaly Detection for IoT') with a socio-technical goal (e.g., 'Quantifying and Enhancing Human Trust in Autonomous Security Systems'). The researcher must leverage his entrepreneurial background to write a compelling 'Broader Impacts' section with a clear 'Transition to Practice' plan. Crucially, he must form a genuine collaboration with a PI from the social sciences (e.g., psychology, economics) who will have a substantive role in the research, which justifies the 'Collaboration Plan' required for larger grants.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a credible, interdisciplinary team by partnering with a researcher from the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) directorate to address the socio-technical aspects of trust.
- Clearly framing the proposal around foundational scientific questions that advance the science of security and trust, rather than presenting it as an engineering or commercialization project.
- Centering the entire narrative on the program's core tenet of 'Trust', for example, by proposing novel Explainable AI (XAI) methods as a mechanism to build and measure confidence in AI-powered security systems.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Overcoming a Perceived Commercialization Bias: His funding history is heavily weighted towards translational grants (SBIR, PFI). The proposal must convince reviewers of his commitment to and capability for conducting deep, foundational research, not just developing a technology.
- Identifying a Strong Social Science Collaborator: His profile is purely technical. The success of a SaTC proposal hinges on genuine interdisciplinary integration. He must proactively find and build a research plan with a collaborator from a field like psychology, sociology, or economics to study the human and societal dimensions of his proposed technology.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal's core technology—on-device AutoML—is directly transferable. The strategy would be to pivot the application domain from general manufacturing to a specific biomanufacturing use case, such as 'Real-time Contamination Detection in Cell Cultures' or 'Predictive Maintenance for Perfusion Bioreactor Systems.' The narrative should focus on how this technology solves a specific, high-value problem identified in a BioMADE project call.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical architecture for the AutoML framework, the discussion of edge computing constraints, the model optimization algorithms, and the performance metrics can be reused. The 'Commercialization Plan' can be adapted to highlight alignment with BioMADE's technology maturation and industry adoption goals.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Although unsuccessful, the core idea of outlier detection for remote assets is perfect. The adaptation would involve reframing 'remote assets' as 'bioreactors' or 'downstream processing units'. The proposal should be tailored to the unique data types and failure modes of bioprocesses, collaborating with a domain expert to define credible use cases and expected impacts.
  - Reusable Elements: The foundational algorithms for outlier detection, the system architecture for data ingestion and analysis, and the arguments for the importance of automated monitoring can be repurposed. The 'lessons learned' from the unsuccessful submission should be used to strengthen the team and industry-partner engagement sections.

**Strategic Positioning:** The researcher should not apply alone. His strategy must be to act as an enabler for a larger team. He should proactively monitor BioMADE's public project calls, identify a project led by a bioprocess engineering expert that requires advanced data analytics, and approach them to join their 'Integrated Project Team' as the AI/ML lead. He can then use this DCL to secure supplemental NSF funding for his portion of the work, making the overall team's proposal to BioMADE more competitive and resource-rich.

#### Success Factors
- Strong Commercialization Acumen: His proven SBIR experience and entrepreneurial profile are a perfect cultural fit for a Manufacturing USA institute like BioMADE.
- High-Demand Technical Skills: The application of Edge AI, anomaly detection, and computer vision to manufacturing is a critical and sought-after expertise that directly addresses industry needs.
- Cross-Disciplinary Innovation: Positioning himself as the bridge between advanced computing and biological engineering places him at a funding sweet spot for NSF.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Eligibility Requirement (Critical): This DCL provides supplemental funding to researchers with *existing active NSF awards*. The profile does not confirm he has one. If he does not, he is ineligible and cannot apply.
- Bio-Domain Knowledge Gap: His profile lacks explicit expertise in microbiology, biochemistry, or bioprocess engineering. Success is contingent on forming a strong partnership with domain experts who can guide the application of his technology and ensure its relevance to a real biological system.

### 33. Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) (Score: 85)

**Program ID:** 506212  
**Compatibility Score:** 85/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is an excellent match for the researcher's advanced computational expertise, provided the proposal focuses on developing novel, fundamental data science methods for a core engineering or science problem, rather than on technology commercialization.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise in Large Language Models (LLMs), Anomaly/Outlier Detection, Explainable AI (XAI), and Machine Learning at the Edge is a superb match for the CDS&E program's core requirement for 'a significant component of computational or data science that goes well beyond what would typically be included'. These areas are at the frontier of computational science. A proposal developing new foundational methods in any of these fields—for instance, novel XAI techniques for complex engineering systems or resource-efficient LLMs for scientific data analysis—would directly address the call's emphasis on pushing the envelope of science and engineering through computation.
- **Research Domain Match:** The alignment is very strong. The researcher's domains of Computer Science and Engineering, with application areas in Manufacturing, IoT, Smart Agriculture, and Clean Energy, map directly onto the interests of several NSF directorates that participate in the CDS&E meta-program, particularly the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE). This cross-disciplinary profile is ideal for CDS&E, which encourages proposals that 'cut across more than one discipline'.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher has a strong track record of securing funding (~$1.2M), demonstrating project management and grant writing capabilities. His success with NSF SBIR grants is highly relevant as it shows familiarity with the NSF ecosystem. However, it also presents a challenge. The SBIR program prioritizes commercialization, whereas CDS&E (and its participating core programs) prioritizes fundamental research and the creation of new scientific knowledge. The unsuccessful proposals (PFI, POSE) may offer more valuable lessons in framing research for non-SBIR NSF programs. His 'Academic Entrepreneur' status can be a major asset for the 'Broader Impacts' section, but the core 'Intellectual Merit' must be grounded in foundational science.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is exceptionally high. The researcher can propose transformative projects by combining his areas of expertise. For example: 1) Developing a new class of hybrid physics-informed and LLM-based models for anomaly detection in complex manufacturing supply chains. 2) Creating fundamentally new Edge AI algorithms for federated, real-time analysis of environmental data from distributed, energy-harvesting IoT sensors. 3) Designing novel XAI frameworks that allow engineers to understand and trust complex AI-driven control systems in clean energy grids. The key is to frame the project around the creation of the *methodology* itself, using the application as the motivating and validating domain.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal's technical core—Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) for resource-constrained devices—is a perfect starting point. To adapt it for CDS&E, the entire commercialization narrative (market size, business model, customers) must be removed. The project should be reframed around a fundamental research question, such as: 'How can we develop a new theoretical framework for AutoML that co-optimizes for predictive accuracy, energy consumption, and model interpretability on edge devices?' The research would focus on creating new search algorithms, performance estimators, or theoretical bounds, with manufacturing or smart agriculture serving as the testbed to demonstrate the new science, not as a target market.
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review on AutoML and Edge AI, the technical description of existing algorithms, the PI's qualifications, and any preliminary technical results can be repurposed. The project description, goals, and evaluation metrics must be completely rewritten to focus on scientific discovery and intellectual merit.

**Strategic Positioning:** The most critical step is to identify a suitable 'home' program within a participating NSF directorate (e.g., a program in the CMMI or ECCS divisions within the ENG directorate). The proposal must first be a perfect fit for that core program. The narrative should then explicitly state how the computational work is a leap beyond what that program typically funds, thus justifying the 'CDS&E:' prefix. The researcher should leverage his entrepreneurial background as a unique strength in the 'Broader Impacts' section, arguing that he has a proven pathway to translate fundamental discoveries into societal and economic benefits, which is a compelling argument for the value of the public's investment in the research.

#### Success Factors
- Clearly identifying a participating NSF core program and tailoring the proposal to its specific scientific scope before layering on the CDS&E component.
- Framing the project around a fundamental research question that advances computational or data science itself, not just applying existing tools to a new domain.
- Explicitly contrasting the proposed work with 'typical' computational approaches to highlight its novelty and justify its consideration under the CDS&E meta-program.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The primary challenge is the mental and narrative shift from a commercialization-focused SBIR mindset to a fundamental-research-focused mindset required for a core NSF program. The proposal's success metrics must be publications, new theories, and open-source tools, not revenue or market share.
- The researcher must perform due diligence to find the right participating 'home' program and deadline. A generic submission to the CDS&E idea without a specific, well-matched program target will be returned without review.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is the ideal foundation. The supplemental request should be framed as the essential experimental validation and at-scale demonstration of the technology developed in this Phase II award. The narrative should be: 'Our active SBIR award has successfully developed a novel framework for AutoML on edge devices. To de-risk this technology for commercialization and advance the science of AI-defined networks, we now require experimental validation on a real-world wireless platform. This supplement will fund the porting, deployment, and testing of our framework on the [Choose specific PAWR platform, e.g., POWDER or COSMOS] testbed to measure performance gains in a complex, non-simulated environment.'
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical background on AutoML and Edge AI, the problem statement, intellectual merit, and broader impacts can be condensed and repurposed. The core algorithms and system architecture described in the SBIR proposal form the 'technology under test' for the supplement.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to position this as a logical, low-risk, high-impact extension of an existing NSF investment. He must explicitly state which active NSF award this would supplement. The proposal should emphasize that the PAWR platforms provide a unique, national resource that is critical for the next phase of his research and cannot be replicated in his own lab. He should reach out to both his original NSF Program Officer and the Program Directors listed on the DCL to discuss the proposed work before submission, which is standard practice for supplements.

#### Success Factors
- Clearly identifying an active NSF award to which this supplement can be attached. This is a non-negotiable eligibility requirement.
- Developing a concrete, well-defined experimental plan that leverages the unique capabilities of a specific PAWR platform (e.g., AERPAW for drone-based agricultural IoT, POWDER for massive MIMO/O-RAN experiments).
- Articulating how the proposed experiments directly advance the original research and/or commercialization goals of the parent NSF award.
- Demonstrating a clear understanding of the PAWR platform's architecture and how his technology would be integrated for testing.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Eligibility is the single biggest challenge. If the researcher does not currently have an active NSF award as a PI or co-PI, he is ineligible for this supplemental funding opportunity.
- Lack of demonstrated prior experience using the PAWR platforms themselves. This can be mitigated by presenting a very detailed and well-researched experimental plan, potentially including letters of support from the PAWR platform's operations team, and budgeting for their technical support.

This combination is innovative and has strong potential for both foundational research and practical application, which is ideal for a center.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technical vision of this proposal (Automated Machine Learning for edge devices) should be elevated from a commercial product focus to an institutional research and education platform. The planning grant proposal would not be to *do* the research, but to plan how to build a center around it. The strategy should be to outline activities like: 1) hosting workshops to recruit faculty and student interest in 'Efficient AI'; 2) establishing formal partnerships with industry and R1 universities for collaboration; 3) designing an integrated research and curriculum plan for undergraduate and graduate students; 4) conducting a needs-assessment for the specialized hardware and software required for a world-class Edge AI lab.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement, literature review, technical approach, and vision for the future of On-Device AI can be directly repurposed as the central research theme of the proposed center. The 'Broader Impacts' and 'Commercialization Plan' sections can be expanded to form the basis of the center's educational outreach, workforce development, and sustainability plans.

**Strategic Positioning:** The overall strategy must shift from a 'project' mindset (like SBIR) to a 'capacity-building' mindset. The proposal's focus should be on the *planning activities* the grant will fund, not the research outcomes themselves. Dr. Reyes should position his entrepreneurial experience as a key strength for building a *sustainable* center with strong industry linkages and tech transfer potential. The proposal should emphasize how this planning grant will enable his MSI to develop the necessary collaborations, strategic vision, and administrative infrastructure to be competitive for a full, multi-million dollar CREST Center award in the future. He must explicitly detail the two-year plan for stakeholder meetings, curriculum design sessions, partnership development, and evaluation framework design.

This demonstrates a thoughtful approach to mitigating barriers for a future full proposal.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **CRITICAL: PI and Institutional Eligibility:** The single greatest unknown and potential disqualifier is whether Dr. Reyes holds a faculty appointment at a designated Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). This is a non-negotiable eligibility requirement for the PI. If his institution is not an MSI, he is ineligible to lead this proposal.
- **Demonstrating a Shift to Center-Scale Thinking:** His funding history, while strong, is centered on project-specific (SBIR) and individual/small-team grants. He must prove he can transition from leading a research project to architecting a large-scale, multi-faceted institutional center focused on education and capacity-building. The narrative must focus on leadership, management, and institutional impact, not just technical innovation.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the core concept from 'monitoring remote assets' to 'monitoring human-agent team dynamics'. The 'outlier detection' technology can be repurposed to detect misunderstandings, unsafe actions, or breakdowns in collaboration between a human and a synthetic agent. This reframes existing technical work into a new, highly relevant HCI problem.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections describing the outlier detection algorithms, data processing pipelines, and system architecture can be heavily reused. The 'Broader Impacts' section can be adapted to focus on workforce enhancement and manufacturing safety instead of just asset protection.
- **NIH LLMs.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Adapt the core LLM architecture and methodologies from the healthcare context to a manufacturing or agricultural task context. The focus would shift from patient/doctor dialogue to human/robot instructional dialogue. The XAI components mentioned would be even more critical in this new context to ensure task clarity and safety.
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review on LLMs, the description of the proposed model architecture, and any preliminary work on fine-tuning or prompting LLMs can be directly adapted. The discussion on the ethical implications and the need for explainability is also highly transferable.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy should be to frame the proposal as a Human-Centered AI project, not just an applied ML project. He should explicitly target a relevant core NSF program that participates in this DCL, such as CISE's 'Human-Centered Computing' (HCC) or 'Robust Intelligence' (RI). The proposal's unique selling proposition is the development of **trustworthy and verifiable human-agent teams for high-stakes industrial tasks, enabled by XAI-enhanced LLMs and real-time computer vision**. Highlighting his entrepreneurial background as a strong 'Broader Impacts' and technology transition plan will be a key differentiator.

#### Success Factors

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is the most valuable starting point. The core intellectual argument for why an open-source ecosystem is needed should be repurposed as the justification for *why a planning workshop is needed*. The focus must shift from a proposal to *build* the ecosystem (the POSE goal) to a proposal to *convene the community* to define the roadmap and challenges for such ecosystems. He should analyze the rejection feedback from the POSE proposal to identify weaknesses (e.g., insufficient community buy-in, scope too narrow/broad) that a workshop could be designed to solve.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire 'Background' and 'Motivation' sections. The 'Intellectual Merit' and 'Broader Impacts' arguments about the importance of open-source software in the domain. The list of identified stakeholders and potential community members can be repurposed as the target audience and potential invitees for the workshop.

**Strategic Positioning:** The strongest strategy is to leverage his unique 'Academic Entrepreneur' profile. He should not propose a generic 'Open Science in AI' workshop. Instead, he should pitch a focused, high-need topic that others are not addressing. Key strategic actions include: 
1. **Form a Diverse Organizing Committee:** Immediately identify and secure commitments from 3-4 other leaders in academia, industry, and major open-source projects to show this is a community-led effort, not a solo project. 
2. **Pitch a Niche:** Focus on 'sustainability' or 'security/IP' for open science. For instance, 'A Planning Workshop on Commercialization and Sustainability Models for Open-Source Scientific Software.' 
3. **Gather Evidence of Need:** Use letters of support from potential participants and industry partners to validate the importance of the chosen workshop theme. Reference the prior POSE effort as evidence of a well-researched, long-standing need.

#### Success Factors

Projects combining his expertise, for example, developing explainable Edge AI for quality control in advanced manufacturing, would be highly relevant to both the NSF's CISE/ENG directorates and the UKRI-EPSRC's remit.
- **Experience Relevance:** A funding record of over $1.2M with 7 successful proposals demonstrates significant experience and credibility as a PI. However, the filenames (e.g., 'NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf') suggest a strong focus on the NSF SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) program. While this proves his ability to secure competitive funding, he will need to adapt his proposal narrative from a commercialization-centric SBIR framework to the fundamental research focus of a standard NSF grant, which is the primary target for this lead agency opportunity. His 'Academic Entrepreneur' profile is a major asset for the 'Broader Impacts' section but the core 'Intellectual Merit' must be grounded in foundational scientific questions.
- **Innovation Potential:** The researcher is well-positioned to propose highly innovative projects. The fusion of his expertise in AI/ML with IoT and manufacturing presents numerous opportunities. For example, a project on 'Federated and Explainable Anomaly Detection for Resilient US-UK Smart Manufacturing Supply Chains' would be timely and impactful. Another innovative angle could be 'Energy-Harvesting-Aware Edge AI for Sustainable Smart Agriculture,' combining his skills in clean energy, IoT, and machine learning in a globally relevant context. The potential to create novel watermarking techniques to protect the intellectual property of co-developed LLMs or digital twin models in a collaborative setting is another powerful, innovative idea.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**

  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement, literature review on outlier detection and asset monitoring, core algorithmic ideas, and preliminary system architecture can be reused and expanded upon.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Generalize the specific business case from the SBIR proposal into a broader scientific inquiry. Frame the project around fundamental questions like: 'How can we create automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks that are provably robust and efficient for resource-constrained edge devices with intermittent power?' Partner with a UK research group specializing in low-power semiconductor design or verification of AI systems to create a compelling hardware-software co-design research plan.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical deep-dive into AutoML, the discussion of on-device AI constraints, and the core machine learning methodologies are highly reusable for the 'Intellectual Merit' section of a standard grant.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to lead with collaboration. First, identify and build a relationship with a high-caliber research group at a UK university whose expertise is complementary, not duplicative (e.g., UK hardware/systems expert to complement US AI/algorithm expert). Co-develop the research questions and plan from the ground up to ensure the project is genuinely integrated. The proposal must then be targeted at a specific NSF core program (e.g., CISE/IIS Robust Intelligence or ENG/CMMI Manufacturing Systems). The mandatory Expression of Interest (EOI) should be meticulously prepared, clearly articulating the scientific synergy and the rationale for why the collaboration is essential to achieving the project goals. The researcher's entrepreneurial background should be leveraged heavily in the Broader Impacts section to detail pathways for economic impact and workforce development in both countries.

#### Success Factors
- Finding a high-caliber UK collaborator with truly complementary expertise, enabling a project that neither team could accomplish alone.
- Successfully framing the research around fundamental scientific questions that align with a core NSF program, while shifting away from the commercialization focus of prior SBIR proposals.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is not about adapting the proposal, but writing a supplemental funding request that builds upon it. The strategy is to: 1. Identify a key technical or commercialization milestone in the Phase II project that is limited by the lack of specialized testing or validation (e.g., 'To ensure commercial adoption, we must validate our on-device AI's performance against NIST-traceable standards for latency and accuracy'). 2. Identify and establish contact with a researcher in a relevant NIST division (e.g., Intelligent Systems Division or Information Technology Laboratory). 3. Draft a 2-3 page request detailing the specific experiments to be conducted at NIST, the personnel who will travel, and how the results will directly enable the achievement of the original SBIR Phase II goals.
  - Reusable Elements: The 'Project Description' and 'Commercialization Plan' sections of the original SBIR proposal should be referenced to provide context and justification. The core argument is that this supplement is a cost-effective way to maximize the return on NSF's original investment by leveraging existing federal infrastructure. The budget from the original proposal is not reusable; a new, small-scale budget for travel and per diem is required.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal should be positioned as a strategic, value-adding activity that enhances an existing NSF investment. The key message is: 'We can significantly accelerate the technical and commercial maturation of our NSF-funded technology by accessing unique, world-class national resources at NIST.' The request must clearly articulate the 'why NIST' and 'why now'—demonstrating that the proposed on-site work is a critical, timely step that cannot be accomplished at the home institution or through other means. Emphasize the benefit to the national interest through the development of more robust and reliable U.S. technology.

#### Success Factors
- **Prerequisite: Active NSF Award:** The entire opportunity is contingent on the researcher being the PI of a current, active NSF research award. This is the first and most critical eligibility checkpoint.
- **A Strong NIST Partner:** Success heavily depends on identifying an enthusiastic NIST collaborator in advance. A letter of collaboration from the NIST partner confirming the visit's feasibility and scientific merit is essential for the request.
- **Consultation with NSF Program Director:** Following the DCL's instructions to discuss the plan with the cognizant NSF Program Director of the parent award before submission is a crucial step for buy-in and guidance.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **Eligibility Verification:** The primary challenge is confirming that the researcher currently has an active NSF award to supplement. If all his awards are closed, he is ineligible.
- **Networking and Partner Identification:** Finding the right individual or lab within the large NIST organization requires significant proactive effort. The researcher will need to research NIST divisions, read publications, and initiate contact to find a suitable partner, which can be a time-consuming preliminary step.

- **Innovation Potential:** Extremely high. The researcher's toolkit can be powerfully combined with other disciplines. For example, he could partner with a cognitive scientist (SBE) to build more human-aligned XAI, a biologist (BIO) to apply anomaly detection to genomic data, or a political scientist (SBE) to use LLMs to analyze political discourse. The MCA's goal to foster such interdisciplinary synergy is a perfect vehicle for his skillset to unlock novel research avenues.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technical content on AutoML and on-device AI is highly relevant. The adaptation strategy is to completely re-frame the project's motivation and goals. Instead of focusing on a commercial product, the proposal should identify a fundamental scientific barrier in efficient AI (e.g., the theoretical limits of compression, the information-theoretic cost of on-device learning). The MCA would be used to partner with a theorist (e.g., in information theory or theoretical computer science) to develop new foundational principles, using the AutoML platform as a testbed for these new theories.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical background, literature review on AI efficiency, the description of the AutoML methods, and preliminary data demonstrating the system's capabilities can be directly repurposed for the 'Intellectual Merit' section.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to craft a compelling narrative of 'reaching a creative plateau'. The proposal should argue that while the researcher's applied/entrepreneurial work has been successful, it has revealed fundamental questions that cannot be answered with his current expertise. He now needs protected time and a new skill set from a partner in a different discipline to advance his entire research program to the next level of scientific inquiry. The chosen partner and the project should be transformational, not incremental. He must clearly answer the question: 'Why is this research not likely to happen without the MCA?'

#### Success Factors
- Crafting a powerful narrative that frames his entrepreneurial success as the motivation for needing a new, fundamental research direction.
- Identifying a high-caliber partner from a complementary discipline and co-developing a truly synergistic research plan that highlights the acquisition of new skills.
- Pivoting the proposal's language and 'Broader Impacts' away from commercial outcomes and towards fundamental knowledge creation, training of students in interdisciplinary research, and dissemination to the scientific community.
- Submitting the proposal to a core program in a relevant directorate (e.g., CISE or ENG) while clearly articulating the interdisciplinary nature of the work.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Overcoming reviewer bias associated with an SBIR-heavy profile. The proposal must proactively and convincingly demonstrate a commitment to fundamental science over commercialization.
- The researcher's record of unsuccessful proposals in more academic NSF programs (PFI, POSE, ExLENT) may indicate a gap in writing for this type of audience. He must focus on strengthening the 'Intellectual Merit' argument based on scientific curiosity rather than market need.
- The significant lead time and effort required to find the right interdisciplinary partner and develop a deep, collaborative plan that goes beyond a superficial partnership.

For instance, a collaboration could explore federated learning for Edge AI across US-Canadian supply chains, develop novel XAI techniques for shared critical infrastructure, or apply LLMs to unique bilingual datasets from the US and Canada. The fusion of the researcher's AI expertise with a Canadian partner's complementary skills or access to unique data/facilities could lead to scientific breakthroughs that would be impossible for either party to achieve alone.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal should be reframed from a technology-transfer focus (PFI) to a fundamental research focus for a core NSF program (e.g., within the CISE Directorate). The central theme of outlier detection for remote asset monitoring is excellent. The adaptation should emphasize novel algorithmic contributions to outlier detection, addressing challenges like data heterogeneity, scalability, or explainability. The collaboration could be justified by monitoring cross-border assets (e.g., energy grids, environmental systems) or by combining US expertise in AI algorithms with Canadian expertise in a specific asset domain (e.g., mining, forestry).
  - Reusable Elements: The core problem statement, literature review on anomaly detection, system architecture, and preliminary data/methodology can be directly reused and expanded upon.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: While this was a successful commercialization proposal, its technical core (AutoML for On-Device AI) is highly relevant for fundamental research. The adaptation strategy is to extract the core scientific challenges and formulate them as research questions. For example: 'How can we design AutoML frameworks that are provably robust under severe power and memory constraints typical of IoT devices?' A Canadian partner could contribute expertise in low-power electronics, novel hardware, or provide a unique testbed (e.g., in smart agriculture or remote environmental sensing).
  - Reusable Elements: The technical background on AutoML and Edge AI, the description of the state-of-the-art, and the core methodology for designing and testing AI models on-device.

**Strategic Positioning:** The primary strategy is to first identify an NSERC-eligible Canadian collaborator whose research is complementary. The project should be conceived as a truly integrated effort where the partnership is essential to achieving the scientific goals. The proposal should then be tailored to a specific, participating NSF program (e.g., a core program in the Division of Information & Intelligent Systems - IIS), following that program's guidelines meticulously while incorporating the special formatting for the NSF-NSERC collaboration. The 'Broader Impacts' section should highlight the value of the international partnership itself, in addition to the project's scientific and societal merits, leveraging the researcher's entrepreneurial background to outline a clear vision for impact.

#### Success Factors
- Strong alignment of AI/ML expertise with the explicit focus of the funding opportunity.
- A proven track record of securing NSF funding, demonstrating familiarity with the agency's standards and review process.
- Expertise in high-impact application areas (manufacturing, IoT, clean energy) which provides a strong basis for a compelling proposal with significant broader impacts.
- Experience in entrepreneurship and tech commercialization provides a credible basis for articulating pathways to real-world impact.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The primary and most critical gap is the lack of an existing Canadian collaborator. This opportunity is inaccessible without identifying and building a strong partnership with an NSERC-eligible researcher.
- The researcher's main funding successes are from the NSF SBIR program. A key challenge will be to pivot the proposal narrative from a commercial product focus to the fundamental research questions and intellectual merit expected in a standard NSF research grant.

### 52. Open Science for Research Data (Score: 85)

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 85/100  
**Summary:** This Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) is an excellent thematic match for Dr. Costilla Reyes, whose expertise in LLMs, data management, and digital IP protection can be leveraged to create novel tools that advance open science principles, provided he targets a suitable underlying NSF program.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Costilla Reyes's technical expertise is strongly aligned with the goals of this DCL. His work with Large Language Models (LLMs) can be directly applied to automate the creation of metadata, improve data discoverability, and ensure compliance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. His expertise in watermarking and Digital IP Protection offers a highly innovative angle: developing systems that ensure proper attribution and provenance for open data, thus encouraging more researchers to share. Furthermore, his experience with IoT, Edge AI, and Computer Vision provides a rich source of complex, real-world data streams that can serve as compelling use cases for the open science tools he might propose.
- **Research Domain Match:** The DCL is domain-agnostic, seeking proposals that advance open science across all fields of S&E. Dr. Reyes's primary domains of Computer Science and Engineering are ideal for creating the foundational tools and platforms this DCL encourages. His application domains, such as Smart Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Clean Energy, represent areas of critical national interest that generate massive datasets, making them perfect testbeds to demonstrate the broader impact of his proposed work.
- **Experience Relevance:** His experience as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with over $1.2M in funding demonstrates a proven ability to lead projects and secure competitive funding. His success with multiple NSF SBIR awards shows he can develop and deliver on tangible technology. Critically, his past submission to the NSF POSE program (Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems) indicates a pre-existing interest and foundational work in this exact area, making him a highly credible applicant. He can leverage lessons learned from that unsuccessful proposal to submit a much stronger one this time.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The fusion of his expertise in Digital IP Protection (watermarking) with the 'open science' mandate is a standout concept. Instead of using watermarking to restrict access, he could frame it as a tool to 'sign' data, ensuring perpetual attribution and tracking usage, which could solve a major cultural barrier to data sharing. Additionally, applying the latest LLM and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to the problem of making complex research datasets and models truly 'reusable' and 'understandable' by a wider scientific audience would be a significant contribution.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is the most direct starting point. Revise this proposal based on reviewer feedback, explicitly referencing DCL nsf20068 in the introduction. The core idea of an open-source ecosystem should be enhanced with a stronger focus on the 'research data' aspect. Integrate the novel watermarking-for-attribution concept and a more detailed plan for using LLMs to automate data curation and metadata generation.
  - Reusable Elements: The core technical framework, the open-source governance model, community engagement plans, and letters of support can be reused and updated. The literature review and project motivation are likely still highly relevant.
- **NIH LLMs.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Repurpose the core LLM concepts for an NSF audience. Frame a new proposal focused on creating an 'LLM-powered Open Science Assistant'—a tool that helps researchers clean, anonymize, document, and deposit their data into public repositories according to FAIR principles. The project should be positioned as core Computer Science research with broad impacts on scientific practice.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical background on LLMs, potential model architectures, and evaluation metrics for language tasks. The core problem statement can be shifted from a specific NIH domain to the general challenge of research data management.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Extract the technical core of the AutoML system and re-frame it for an academic, open-source context. The proposal could be for an 'Open-Source Framework for Reproducible and FAIR AutoML'. The focus would shift from a commercial product to a public tool that allows other researchers to easily apply AutoML to open datasets and share the resulting models in a transparent and explainable manner, using XAI techniques.
  - Reusable Elements: The detailed description of the AutoML pipeline, the technical architecture, and the performance benchmarks. The 'Intellectual Merit' section can be built directly from this technical foundation.

**Strategic Positioning:** The key strategy is to submit a proposal to a relevant, existing NSF program (e.g., POSE, CISE Core Programs, Cyber-Physical Systems) while explicitly stating in the project summary and introduction that the work is in response to DCL nsf20068. He should frame his entrepreneurial experience as a strength for building a sustainable and widely adopted open-source tool, not a commercial product. The proposal must clearly articulate how the proposed tool will lower barriers for other researchers to practice open science, using one of his application domains (e.g., Smart Agriculture) as a concrete example of impact.

#### Success Factors
- Clearly referencing DCL nsf20068 to signal alignment with NSF's strategic priorities.
- Articulating the novel vision of using digital watermarking to enhance, rather than restrict, open science by ensuring attribution.
- Leveraging prior SBIR and POSE proposal experience to present a mature, credible plan for developing a sustainable open-source ecosystem.
- Securing strong letters of collaboration from researchers in a target science domain who commit to using the proposed tools.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The primary challenge is recognizing that this DCL is not a funding program itself. A proposal cannot be submitted 'to the DCL'; it must be tailored to and submitted to an appropriate underlying NSF program, observing that program's specific deadlines and requirements.
- Shifting the narrative from the commercialization focus of his successful SBIRs to the community-building and public-benefit focus required for an open-science proposal. The metrics for success are adoption and scientific impact, not revenue.
- The researcher's profile lacks an explicit mention of experience with data curation, library science, or existing open-science repository technologies. Collaborating with a data steward or academic librarian could significantly strengthen the proposal.

### 53. Frontera Leadership-Class Computing Allocations (Score: 85)

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 85/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is an excellent match, providing the necessary leadership-class computing resources to scale Dr. Reyes's extensive expertise in Large Language Models and large-scale AI from commercially-focused projects to foundational, grand-challenge science.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Reyes's technical expertise in Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision, and Explainable AI (XAI) aligns perfectly with the intended use of a leadership-class system like Frontera. Training foundational LLMs, developing novel architectures for massive-scale computer vision tasks in manufacturing, or conducting large-scale experiments to understand the inner workings of complex models (XAI) are all computationally intensive problems that demand the peta-scale capabilities offered by this opportunity. His work in Edge AI, while seemingly opposite, can be powerfully framed: using Frontera to discover and train massive parent models that can then be distilled or optimized for edge deployment, a significant research challenge in itself.
- **Research Domain Match:** The opportunity focuses on providing cyberinfrastructure and is thus agnostic to the specific research domain, as long as the computational need is justified. Dr. Reyes's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are primary consumers of such high-performance computing (HPC) resources. He can compellingly argue that advancing fields like Smart Agriculture or Clean Energy (via simulation and modeling) or revolutionizing Manufacturing Quality Assurance (via training a foundational vision model) requires the unique scale of Frontera.
- **Experience Relevance:** With seven successful proposals and over $1.2M in funding, Dr. Reyes has proven his ability to secure competitive funding. His significant experience with NSF, particularly through the SBIR program, demonstrates a familiarity with the agency's goals and review processes. While an allocation proposal differs from a funding grant, his track record is a strong indicator of his ability to frame a compelling project. His entrepreneurial background adds a valuable 'broader impacts' narrative, suggesting that the foundational research conducted on Frontera will be translated into real-world applications.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is extremely high. Dr. Reyes could propose a project that addresses a 'grand challenge' in his field. For example: 1) Training a first-of-its-kind foundational LLM specifically for scientific and engineering literature to accelerate discovery in materials science or drug design. 2) Developing a massive-scale digital twin for a complex manufacturing process, using real-time IoT data and advanced computer vision, which can only be simulated on a system like Frontera. 3) Conducting a definitive, large-scale study on XAI techniques for foundational models, which is currently a major unsolved problem in AI safety and trustworthiness.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NIH LLMs.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful proposal is likely the best starting point. The core idea was probably strong, but it may have been deemed infeasible without access to leadership-class computing. The strategy is to reframe the entire proposal around the *need* for Frontera. Transform the scientific aims into a 'grand challenge' problem and build a detailed computational plan (e.g., scaling laws, model parallelism strategy, data management) that explicitly justifies why Frontera is the *only* platform capable of achieving the project's goals.
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review, the core scientific question related to LLMs, the proposed model architecture, and the potential impact statement can likely be reused and expanded upon.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The concept of AutoML can be scaled dramatically. Propose a project titled 'Scaling AutoML for Scientific Discovery on Leadership-Class Systems.' The goal would be to use Frontera's power to run a massive-scale Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to discover novel, high-performance AI models for a specific, complex scientific problem (e.g., predicting protein folding, simulating turbulent flow, or optimizing clean energy grids). This leverages his past success but elevates the scale and scientific ambition.
  - Reusable Elements: The core methodology of AutoML, justification for automated model design, and performance metrics can be adapted. The 'On-Device' aspect would be replaced by a 'for-HPC' or 'for-Science' focus.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy must be to pivot from a commercialization-focused mindset (SBIR) to a foundational science-focused one. The proposal should not be about developing a product, but about answering a fundamental question or creating a public resource (like a foundational model) that enables future science and innovation. The application must meticulously detail the computational requirements, including benchmark data from smaller systems to project performance and justify the need for Frontera's specific scale and architecture. Emphasize how this computational work will uniquely enable breakthroughs in his application areas (manufacturing, energy, etc.) and create broader impacts for the scientific community.

#### Success Factors
- Clearly articulating a 'grand challenge' scientific question that is fundamentally intractable without access to a peta-scale system like Frontera.
- Providing concrete technical justification and a detailed computational plan, including scaling analysis, that proves the project is a perfect fit for the resource.
- Leveraging his deep LLM and ML expertise to propose a novel project that pushes the boundaries of the field, rather than just an incremental scaling of existing work.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Transitioning from SBIR to a Resource Allocation Mindset: The proposal's narrative must shift from commercial outcomes to fundamental scientific discovery and enabling community resources. This is a significantly different style of proposal writing.
- Demonstrating HPC Expertise: Dr. Reyes's profile emphasizes Edge AI and On-Device AI, which involve resource constraints. He must explicitly demonstrate that his team possesses the necessary High-Performance Computing (HPC) skills (e.g., MPI, large-scale data management, parallel I/O) to effectively utilize a supercomputer. If this is a gap, partnering with a computational scientist or a center at his university is critical.

### 54. OAC: OAC Core Research (OAC Core) (Score: 85)

**Program ID:** 505670  
**Compatibility Score:** 85/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is an excellent technical match for the researcher's expertise in AI/ML and IoT, but a successful proposal will require a strategic pivot from a commercialization focus to creating foundational, scalable cyberinfrastructure for a specific scientific research domain.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise in Anomaly/Outlier Detection, Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI), and IoT aligns exceptionally well with the goals of the OAC Core program. These skills directly address the challenges of managing and processing data from the 'spectrum of computational, data, software, networking, and security resources' mentioned in the synopsis. For instance, Edge AI and IoT expertise can be applied to develop novel, scalable cyberinfrastructure for distributed scientific instruments (e.g., environmental sensor networks, telescopes). LLMs could be used to create new, intelligent interfaces for complex high-performance computing (HPC) systems, while watermarking techniques could be researched as a foundational CI service for data provenance and integrity in massive, shared scientific datasets.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are the primary domains funded by the OAC Core program, which sits within the NSF's Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) directorate. The opportunity's listed research areas of 'artificial_intelligence', 'cybersecurity', 'cyberinfrastructure', and 'engineering_technology' are a direct overlap. The key is to frame the research not as an application of ML to a problem, but as fundamental research *on* the cyberinfrastructure needed to enable science at scale.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher has a strong track record of securing over $1.2M in funding, demonstrating the ability to write compelling, technically sound proposals. The significant experience with NSF SBIR programs, while commercially focused, proves an aptitude for creating 'deployable' systems—a key tenet of this OAC Core program. This experience as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' can be framed as a strength in understanding the full lifecycle of technology from research to practical implementation. The challenge and opportunity is to redirect this translational expertise from commercial products to sustainable, open, and scalable research CI tools and services for the scientific community.
- **Innovation Potential:** The researcher is well-positioned to propose innovative CI solutions. A highly innovative proposal could combine multiple areas of expertise, for example: 'A Framework for Self-Managing, AI-Driven Cyberinfrastructure for Large-Scale Distributed Experiments.' This could leverage Edge AI and anomaly detection for real-time data filtering and instrument control at the source, coupled with LLMs at the core to provide a natural language interface for scientists to query and manage the distributed system. This directly addresses the call's aim for 'next-generation, extreme-scale research CI' by creating a more autonomous and intelligent infrastructure layer.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the proposal from a commercial product to a foundational CI research project. The goal should not be a commercializable 'OnDeviceAI' product, but rather a new, open-source, and sustainable AutoML framework as a *service* for the scientific community. Frame it as 'CI for AI': creating the infrastructure that allows domain scientists (e.g., biologists, climatologists) to easily develop and deploy their own specialized AI models onto distributed sensors and edge devices without needing extensive CS expertise. This meets the 'deployable, scalable, and sustainable' criteria.
  - Reusable Elements: The core technical sections describing the AutoML process, the methods for model compression, and the architecture for on-device deployment are highly reusable. The literature review on edge AI and AutoML can be directly adapted.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful PFI proposal is an excellent candidate for adaptation because its theme is already translational. The key is to replace 'Remote Asset Monitoring' (which implies industrial/commercial assets) with 'Remote Scientific Instrument Monitoring' for an extreme-scale science application. Fulfill the OAC Core collaborator requirement by partnering with a scientist from a field like high-energy physics (monitoring particle detector components), seismology (monitoring a network of sensors), or climate science (monitoring ocean buoys). The research focus would shift from a specific solution to developing the fundamental scalable algorithms and data infrastructure for real-time outlier detection in massive, noisy scientific data streams.
  - Reusable Elements: The core algorithms for outlier detection, the system architecture for data ingestion and processing, and the discussion of challenges in remote monitoring can be reused. The 'Intellectual Merit' section can be repurposed by strengthening the focus on CI research challenges.

**Strategic Positioning:** The overarching strategy must be to frame the project as fundamental Cyberinfrastructure Research that enables new science. The proposal title, summary, and introduction must explicitly use OAC keywords like 'scalable,' 'sustainable,' 'deployable,' 'cyberinfrastructure,' and 'translational research.' The project must be co-led or developed with a strong collaborator from a science or engineering discipline who can provide a compelling, data-intensive use case. The proposal should emphasize the creation of a generalizable, open-source tool or framework that will empower a broad community of researchers, rather than a single, bespoke solution.

#### Success Factors
- Secure a strong collaboration with a domain scientist (e.g., from climate science, genomics, astronomy) whose research presents a clear extreme-scale data or computation challenge that the proposed CI can solve. This collaborator should be integrated into the proposal as co-PI or senior personnel.
- Explicitly frame the research as advancing the field of Cyberinfrastructure itself, focusing on the novelty of the CI methods for scalability, sustainability, and broad deployability, rather than just applying known ML techniques to a new dataset.
- Articulate a clear and credible plan for community engagement, dissemination, and adoption. This should include plans for releasing open-source software, holding tutorials at scientific conferences, and creating documentation to ensure the resulting CI is a sustainable resource for the research community.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Shifting the proposal's narrative from a commercialization mindset (prevalent in SBIRs) to a focus on creating public, open, and foundational research infrastructure. The metrics for success are scientific impact and community adoption, not market penetration.
- Identifying a compelling 'extreme-scale' science driver. The researcher's expertise in edge/IoT must be connected to a problem that is convincingly large-scale (e.g., managing tens of thousands of real-time sensors for a national-scale experiment) to align with the 'Advanced CI' and 'HPC/Big Data' context of the OAC program.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned with the opportunity's goals. The call for integrating 'Big Data, Informatics' and creating 'Smart' systems directly maps to his skills in Machine Learning, Anomaly Detection, IoT, and Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI). His experience with Computer Vision can be applied to crop monitoring, pest detection, and yield analysis. Furthermore, his work in Low-power electronics and Energy Harvesting is critical for deploying sustainable IoT sensor networks in agricultural fields. The expertise in Explainable AI (XAI) is a significant asset, as it can be used to build trust and facilitate the adoption of new technologies by farmers and stakeholders.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning form the technological core of this opportunity. The program explicitly seeks to fund research at the 'intersection' of these fields with Agricultural Science. While his profile lists 'Smart Agriculture Technologies,' indicating interest and likely some experience, the success of a proposal will hinge on forming a genuine, interdisciplinary team. He represents one half of the required equation; a strong collaboration with experts in plant science, soil science, or animal science is essential to ground the technology in real-world agricultural challenges.
- **Experience Relevance:** With over $1.2M in funding and 7 successful proposals, the researcher has a proven ability to secure competitive grants. His status as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' is highly relevant to NSF's emphasis on 'Broader Impacts' and translating research into societal benefit. However, many of his listed proposals appear to be SBIR-focused, which are oriented towards commercialization. For this DCL, which points to foundational research programs like CPS and IIS, he must pivot the narrative from developing a product to answering fundamental scientific questions, using agriculture as the driving application domain.
- **Innovation Potential:** The researcher is well-positioned to make innovative contributions. The application of his expertise in Edge AI to agricultural settings can lead to breakthroughs in real-time, on-farm decision support systems that operate with limited connectivity. Combining Anomaly Detection with distributed sensor networks could create early-warning systems for crop disease, water stress, or equipment failure. His work with LLMs could be used to create novel systems that integrate diverse data streams (e.g., weather forecasts, soil data, market prices, satellite imagery) into a coherent, actionable advisory service for farmers.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Reframe the core technology from a general context to a specific agricultural challenge. For example, adapt the 'On-Device AI' to perform real-time pest identification on a smart trap or disease classification on a drone-mounted camera. The 'AutoML' component can be positioned as a tool to empower agronomists or farmers to customize ML models for their specific local conditions without needing deep AI expertise. The proposal must shift focus from a commercial product to the underlying research questions about making AutoML robust and efficient in variable agricultural environments.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical architecture for on-device AI, algorithms for model compression and optimization (Edge AI), the framework for automated machine learning, and discussion of low-power hardware constraints.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the 'Remote Asset Monitoring' use case to high-value agricultural assets. This could include monitoring the health and behavior of livestock via wearables, tracking the operational status of autonomous tractors or irrigation systems, or monitoring the micro-climate within a network of smart greenhouses. The 'Outlier Detection' algorithms can be adapted to identify early signs of animal illness, impending equipment failure, or sub-optimal growing conditions.
  - Reusable Elements: The core algorithms for anomaly and outlier detection, the system architecture for ingesting and processing remote sensor data, and the methods for data stream analysis.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to leverage his strong CS/Engineering expertise as the foundation for a deeply collaborative project. First, he must identify and partner with one or more researchers from an agricultural science department who can define a compelling problem, provide domain expertise, and offer access to data or field testbeds. Second, he should carefully select the target NSF program (CPS, IIS-III, or S&CC) that best fits the project's focus—CPS for sensor-actuator systems, IIS for data analytics and ML models, or S&CC for socio-technical community impact. Finally, the proposal must be meticulously framed to highlight fundamental research contributions, with the agricultural application serving as the powerful motivation and validation context, ensuring the title is prefixed with 'DATAg:' as required.

#### Success Factors
- Strong, demonstrated expertise in high-demand technologies (Edge AI, IoT, ML) that are central to the future of digital agriculture.
- A successful funding track record and entrepreneurial experience, which strengthens the 'Broader Impacts' criterion by showing a clear path to real-world application.
- The ability to propose novel, resource-efficient systems (e.g., low-power electronics, Edge AI) that are practical for deployment in agricultural settings.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The Collaboration Gap: The single greatest challenge is the need to form a strong, credible partnership with agricultural scientists. A proposal submitted without such a collaboration will not be competitive.
- Pivoting from Commercialization to Foundational Research: The researcher must adapt his proposal narrative from the commercial focus of SBIRs to the fundamental research questions prioritized by core NSF programs like CPS and IIS.
- Data and Domain Access: Securing access to relevant, high-quality agricultural datasets and field environments for testing and validation is critical and will likely depend on the strength of the agricultural science collaborator.

His expertise in 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' and 'Explainable AI (XAI)' can be applied to create trusted and robust sensing systems, a key aspect of the program. The challenge will be to explicitly connect these AI/ML innovations to the hardware layer (circuits, antennas, MEMS) that is central to the CCSS program.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are highly congruent with the CCSS program's focus on integrating computation, communication, and sensing with physical domains. The CCSS program lists application areas like manufacturing, energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring, all of which are directly mirrored in Dr. Reyes' expertise in 'Manufacturing Quality Assurance', 'Clean Energy', 'Wearable Technology', and 'Smart Agriculture Technologies'. This strong alignment in application domains ensures the proposed research will be relevant to the program's broader impact goals.
- **Experience Relevance:** As a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with over $1.2M in funding and multiple successful NSF SBIR grants, Dr. Reyes is an ideal candidate. His experience demonstrates the ability to not only conduct fundamental research but also to understand its practical application and commercial potential, a perspective highly valued in engineering directorates. The success with NSF SBIR proposals on 'AutoML' and 'OnDeviceAI' is particularly relevant, as it shows a history of successful engagement with the NSF on topics central to a potential CCSS proposal. His track record significantly de-risks the investment from the NSF's perspective.
- **Innovation Potential:** The primary innovation potential lies in the co-design of intelligent algorithms and underlying hardware. Dr. Reyes can propose novel systems where Edge AI algorithms are not just running on generic hardware but are deeply integrated with the sensing and communication circuits themselves. For example, he could propose research on 'Explainable AI (XAI) for trusted microelectronics', where the AI provides real-time validation of circuit integrity. Another innovative angle is using his Edge AI expertise to create adaptive and reconfigurable RF and sensing systems that learn and optimize their performance in real-time based on environmental data, directly addressing a stated interest of the CCSS program directors.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This SBIR proposal's technical core is perfectly aligned. To adapt it for CCSS, the focus must shift from commercialization to fundamental research. Frame the project around the core scientific questions: 'How can we co-design low-power circuits and AutoML algorithms for optimal performance in resource-constrained IoT sensors?' or 'What new sensing system architectures are enabled by on-device learning?'. The proposal should emphasize the creation of new engineering principles and generalizable knowledge, rather than a specific product.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical background on AutoML and Edge AI, system architecture diagrams for on-device processing, preliminary data demonstrating feasibility, and the problem definition for a specific application domain (e.g., manufacturing QA or smart agriculture) can be directly reused or adapted.
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: As a Phase II proposal, this document likely contains more mature technical details and results. This content can be repurposed to serve as strong preliminary data for a CCSS proposal. The adaptation strategy is similar to the Phase I: pivot from the business case to fundamental research. Position the demonstrated Phase II success as proof of feasibility for a more ambitious, foundational research project under CCSS that explores the limits of hardware/software co-design for intelligent sensing.
  - Reusable Elements: Advanced technical descriptions, validated system performance metrics, detailed architectural designs, and results from prototype deployments can be leveraged to build a very strong 'Broader Impacts' and 'Intellectual Merit' section.

**Strategic Positioning:** The most competitive strategy is to propose a 'Hardware-AI Co-Design' project. The narrative should not treat hardware as a static platform for software innovation. Instead, it should focus on the symbiotic relationship: how novel Edge AI techniques can actively reconfigure and optimize sensing circuits in real-time, and conversely, how novel circuit designs (e.g., in-memory computing, ultra-low-power ASICs) can unlock new capabilities for Edge AI. The proposal should explicitly use the language of the CCSS program, focusing on 'cyber-physical systems', 'sensing systems', 'circuits', and 'signal processing' to ensure it is reviewed by the appropriate experts.

#### Success Factors
- Direct and powerful alignment of expertise (Edge AI, IoT, low-power systems) with a specific, stated interest of the CCSS program: 'dynamic-data-enabled autonomous systems'.
- Proven track record of securing NSF funding, particularly SBIR grants on a highly relevant topic, which validates both technical competence and project management capability.
- The 'Academic Entrepreneur' profile, which ensures the proposed research is grounded in high-impact, real-world applications (manufacturing, energy, healthcare) that are priorities for CCSS.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Demonstrating Hardware Innovation: The researcher's profile is stronger on the AI/software side. The proposal must convincingly detail innovation at the circuit, signal processing, or physical system-architecture level to be competitive in a hardware-focused program like CCSS. Collaboration with a circuit design expert could mitigate this gap.
- Pivoting from Commercial to Fundamental Focus: The proposal must avoid the language and framing of an SBIR or PFI grant. The core motivation must be the pursuit of new scientific knowledge and engineering principles, with commercialization being a potential long-term outcome, not the primary driver.

### 57. Engineering Design and Systems Engineering (EDSE) (Score: 85)

**Program ID:** 505478  
**Compatibility Score:** 85/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match due to excellent alignment between the researcher's AI/ML expertise and the program's focus on 'AI in design', but success requires a strategic shift from an applied/commercialization focus to fundamental design science research.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned with the EDSE program's areas of interest. His skills in 'Data science and artificial intelligence in design' are a direct hit. Specifically: 'Large Language Models (LLMs)' can be applied to 'design representation' and 'design collaboration'; 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' and 'Explainable AI (XAI)' are perfect for 'design validation' and 'design cognition'; 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)' and 'IoT' directly address 'robotics and intelligent system design' and 'design at extreme scales and in extreme environments'. His work in 'Manufacturing Quality Assurance' provides a tangible domain to test new design principles for processes and systems.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are a perfect fit. The EDSE program is situated within the NSF's Engineering directorate and explicitly calls for the integration of computational sciences. He is well-positioned to propose research that merges these fields to create new, computationally-driven design and systems engineering methodologies.
- **Experience Relevance:** His track record of securing over $1.2M in funding demonstrates a proven ability to write successful proposals. However, his experience appears heavily weighted towards SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) grants. While this proves his ability to deliver tangible results, the EDSE program is focused on 'fundamental research' and 'design science'. He must pivot his narrative from commercial application (the goal of SBIR) to the creation of fundamental 'new knowledge' and 'theory' in design (the goal of EDSE). His entrepreneurial background is a major asset for the 'Broader Impacts' section but could be a liability if it overshadows the 'Intellectual Merit' of the proposal.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The researcher can propose transformative research at the intersection of AI and engineering design. For example, he could investigate how LLMs can create novel frameworks for generative design of complex systems, how XAI can be used to model and improve human 'design cognition' in partnership with AI tools, or how Edge AI can enable self-validating and adaptive engineered systems in real-time. This moves beyond simply applying AI to a problem and towards studying how AI changes the fundamental science of how we design.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technology (AutoML on-device) is highly relevant. The adaptation strategy is to shift the research question from 'How can we build a commercial tool for on-device AI?' to 'How does the principle of automated machine learning under extreme computational constraints (Edge AI) create a new paradigm for design optimization and validation?'. The project should be framed as a fundamental study of resource-aware design science, using manufacturing or smart agriculture as a testbed to validate the new theories, not as a commercialization plan.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections describing the AutoML and Edge AI architecture, the state-of-the-art literature review on machine learning, and the description of the application domain (e.g., manufacturing) can be reused as the experimental validation context for the proposed fundamental research.

**Strategic Positioning:** The most competitive strategy is to frame the proposal around a core question in design science, explicitly using the program's vocabulary. For instance: 'This research investigates a new theory of Human-AI Collaborative Design Cognition, where Explainable AI (XAI) is used to model, understand, and augment the decision-making processes of engineers.' This requires securing a collaborator from cognitive science or human-computer interaction (HCI) to fulfill the 'multidisciplinary' nature strongly encouraged by the program. The proposal should clearly separate the 'Intellectual Merit' (the new design science knowledge) from the 'Broader Impacts' (the potential for future applications, where his entrepreneurial experience can be highlighted).

#### Success Factors
- Successfully reframing applied AI/ML work into a fundamental research question about design science or systems science.
- Securing a strong collaborator from a complementary field such as cognitive science, systems theory, or human-computer interaction (HCI) to create a truly multidisciplinary proposal.
- Developing a rigorous plan to assess the proposed methods not just for performance, but for their ability to generate new, generalizable knowledge about the act of design itself.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The researcher's extensive SBIR background presents a risk of writing a proposal that is too focused on application and product development, which is a common reason for rejection from fundamental science programs like EDSE.
- The current profile does not mention collaborators in the social, behavioral, or design theory domains, which are explicitly encouraged by the program and often essential for a competitive proposal.

### 58. Facilitating Research at Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions: (RUI and ROA-PUI) (Score: 85)

**Program ID:** 5518  
**Compatibility Score:** 85/100  
**Summary:** This is an excellent potential match if your institution qualifies as a PUI, as the RUI mechanism is specifically designed to leverage your strong technical expertise in AI/ML to fund fundamental research that directly involves undergraduate students, though you will need to pivot from your commercialization-focused narrative to an academic and educational one.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The alignment is exceptionally strong. The RUI/ROA mechanism is topic-agnostic and relies on the underlying NSF disciplinary programs. Your expertise in Anomaly/Outlier Detection, LLMs, IoT, and Edge AI aligns perfectly with multiple programs within the NSF Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE), such as Robust Intelligence (RI), Computer Systems Research (CSR), and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). You can frame a cutting-edge research project that would be highly competitive on its intellectual merit alone.
- **Research Domain Match:** The opportunity's primary domain is facilitating research at PUIs, with a mandatory component of education and student involvement. Your research domains (CS, Engineering, ML) are a perfect fit for NSF. The key requirement will be to explicitly and convincingly integrate the 'education' domain. Your profile highlights technical and entrepreneurial success but not undergraduate research mentorship. To succeed, you must frame your project around training the next generation of STEM professionals, which is a core goal of the RUI program.
- **Experience Relevance:** Your funding history of over $1.2M from 7 successful proposals is a major asset, demonstrating your ability to write compelling, fundable grants. However, your documented success appears heavily concentrated in NSF's SBIR program, which focuses on commercialization. RUI proposals are reviewed by core disciplinary programs where the emphasis is on fundamental research, intellectual merit, and broader impacts (especially student training). You must demonstrate that you can pivot from a commercialization narrative to an academic research and education narrative. Your experience as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' is valuable but must be positioned as a 'Broader Impact' (e.g., training students for innovation) rather than the central goal.
- **Innovation Potential:** Your innovation potential is very high. Proposing research on topics like Explainable AI (XAI) for IoT anomaly detection, efficient watermarking for LLM-generated content, or energy-harvesting for Edge AI systems would be seen as highly innovative. The unique innovation for an RUI proposal will be in how you creatively integrate undergraduate students into this advanced research, providing them with an unparalleled training experience not typically available at larger, R1 institutions.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful PFI proposal is a better starting point than your SBIR grants because PFI is closer to fundamental research. Transform this into an RUI proposal by: (1) Reframing the core objective from 'technology translation' to 'answering fundamental questions' about outlier detection in resource-constrained environments. (2) Removing all commercialization plan language. (3) Designing a new 'Broader Impacts' section centered on undergraduate research. (4) Writing a new, mandatory 5-page 'RUI Impact Statement' detailing how the project will build research capacity at your institution and provide specific, meaningful research tasks for undergraduate students.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical core can be reused: the literature review, the description of the outlier detection problem, the proposed technical approach, and the preliminary data/methods. The 'Intellectual Merit' section can be adapted directly, focusing on the novelty of the research itself.

**Strategic Positioning:** Your path to a successful RUI proposal is clear: 1) **Confirm Eligibility:** First, confirm your institution meets the PUI definition (≤20 PhDs/D.Sc. in NSF fields in the last two years). If not, this opportunity is not a fit. 2) **Contact the Program Officer:** Identify the most relevant program in CISE (e.g., Robust Intelligence) and contact the PO. Pitch your idea and explicitly state you plan to submit it as an RUI proposal. This is mandatory. 3) **Center the Students:** Your proposal narrative must be built around the undergraduate experience. Detail a recruitment plan (targeting underrepresented groups is a plus), define specific research tasks for students (e.g., data collection, model testing, programming simple modules), and describe mentorship activities. 4) **Write the RUI Impact Statement:** This is a critical document. Use it to 'sell' the unique environment of your PUI. Describe how this grant will transform your research capabilities and create a pipeline of well-trained students for graduate school and high-tech careers. Frame your entrepreneurial background as a benefit to students, showing them the full lifecycle of innovation.

#### Success Factors
- Your strong track record in securing competitive NSF funding, which establishes credibility with reviewers.
- Your expertise in high-demand, cutting-edge AI/ML fields that are a priority for NSF's core disciplinary programs.
- The RUI designation itself, which ensures your proposal is evaluated in the context of your institution's teaching focus and provides a dedicated section to highlight the project's educational impact.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **Institutional Eligibility:** The single biggest unknown is whether your institution qualifies as a PUI. If it does not, your compatibility is zero.
- **Pivoting the Narrative:** You must shift your grant writing style away from the commercial-impact focus of your successful SBIR proposals to the fundamental-research and educational-impact focus required by RUI and core NSF programs. This is a non-trivial change in audience and emphasis.
- **Demonstrating Educational Impact:** Your profile lacks explicit details on mentoring undergraduate researchers. You will need to build a convincing and detailed plan for student involvement and institutional capacity-building from the ground up to be competitive.

### 59. Research Experiences for Teachers: Supplement Opportunity (RET) (Score: 85)

**Program ID:** 503658  
**Compatibility Score:** 85/100  
**Summary:** This is an excellent opportunity to broaden the impact of Dr. Reyes's cutting-edge AI and IoT research through K-12 outreach, provided he currently holds an eligible NSF research award to which this supplement can be attached.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Excellent. Dr. Reyes's expertise in Machine Learning, LLMs, IoT, Edge AI, and Computer Vision represents the exact 'cutting edge of science' that the RET program aims to expose teachers to. These topics are highly relevant and can be translated into engaging, modern curricula for K-12 students. For example, a teacher could participate in a project on developing a simple computer vision model for quality control or using low-power IoT sensors for environmental monitoring, providing tangible and exciting real-world applications of STEM principles.
- **Research Domain Match:** Strong. The researcher's domains of Computer Science and Engineering are core STEM fields central to the RET program. His application-focused work in Smart Agriculture, Manufacturing QA, and Clean Energy provides compelling, real-world contexts that a teacher can use to make complex topics relatable and inspiring for students. This alignment facilitates the core goal of the RET: translating research experience into effective classroom teaching.
- **Experience Relevance:** High, with a critical caveat. Dr. Reyes's track record of securing over $1.2M in funding demonstrates his ability to write compelling, well-structured proposals. His status as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' is a unique strength, offering a teacher perspective on not just basic research but also technology commercialization and societal impact. However, the listed successful proposals appear to be primarily NSF SBIR grants, which are awarded to small businesses. RET supplements are typically attached to traditional academic research grants (e.g., from directorates like CISE, ENG). His eligibility is entirely contingent on holding such a non-SBIR/STTR award at his academic institution.
- **Innovation Potential:** Very High. The opportunity to place a K-12 teacher in a lab focused on applied AI and Edge computing is highly innovative. Unlike more traditional lab experiences, this could lead to the development of novel, project-based curricula on topics like 'How AI works,' 'Building your first IoT device,' or 'The ethics of LLMs.' Dr. Reyes can provide a unique experience that bridges fundamental computer science with tangible, entrepreneurial outcomes, which is a powerful message for aspiring young scientists and engineers.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is a supplemental request, not a full proposal, so adaptation involves distillation, not rewriting. The core strategy is to draft a 2-3 page 'Description of Proposed Work' for the supplement. This document should: 1) Briefly reference the parent award's goals. 2) Propose a self-contained summer project for a teacher based on the AutoML On-Device AI technology (e.g., 'Using AutoML tools to build and test a simple image classifier for classroom use'). 3) Detail the mentoring plan and activities designed to help the teacher develop a lesson plan based on their research experience. 4) Emphasize the partnership with a local, underserved school district.
  - Reusable Elements: From this proposal, Dr. Reyes can reuse: the high-level description of the AutoML technology to establish the 'cutting-edge' context; simplified diagrams illustrating the machine learning pipeline; and real-world application examples that the teacher can incorporate into their curriculum.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is relational and logistical, not creative writing. First, Dr. Reyes must confirm he holds an eligible, active NSF award and contact the cognizant Program Director to discuss this opportunity. Second, he should proactively forge a partnership with a local K-12 school, prioritizing a school in an underserved district to align with the solicitation's emphasis. A letter of collaboration from a principal or district superintendent would significantly strengthen the request. The supplement narrative must be framed around the professional development of the teacher and the ultimate benefit to K-12 students, using his exciting research as the means to that end.

#### Success Factors
- Confirming Eligibility and Program Director Buy-In: The absolute first step is to verify that he has a parent award eligible for an RET supplement and to secure enthusiastic support from his NSF Program Director.
- Establishing a Strong School Partnership: Proactively identifying and building a relationship with a partner school/teacher, especially from an underserved community, will demonstrate commitment and feasibility.
- A Clear, Teacher-Centric Project Plan: The proposal must clearly articulate a meaningful, achievable summer research project for the teacher, with a well-defined mentoring structure and explicit time allocated for curriculum development.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Eligibility of Parent Award: The primary and most critical challenge is the potential mismatch between his documented SBIR funding and the types of academic grants that typically host RET supplements. This must be clarified immediately.
- Demonstrating Broader Impacts/Educational Experience: Dr. Reyes's profile is heavily focused on technical and commercialization expertise. He will need to convincingly demonstrate his capacity and commitment to mentoring a K-12 teacher and facilitating curriculum development, a skill set not explicitly shown in his profile. Partnering with a colleague from a university's College of Education could mitigate this gap.

### 60. Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable Open Science (FAIROS) (Score: 80)

**Program ID:** 505943  
**Compatibility Score:** 80/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match, leveraging the researcher's advanced AI/ML and cyberinfrastructure expertise, but requires a strategic pivot from a commercialization-heavy (SBIR) background to a foundational, open-science framework focused on creating sustainable and broadly reusable research infrastructure.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned with the FAIROS program's goals. His skills in Large Language Models (LLMs) can be directly applied to automate metadata generation and improve semantic search, enhancing data 'Findability' and 'Accessibility'. Expertise in Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for making AI models themselves 'Reusable' and transparent research products. Watermarking and Digital IP Protection techniques can be framed as methods to ensure data provenance and integrity, key components of 'Reusability'. His work in IoT, Edge AI, and Smart Agriculture provides ideal use cases for developing and testing FAIROS frameworks on complex, high-volume, distributed data streams, directly addressing the program's aim to lower barriers to data management.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's core domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are the enabling fields for the cyberinfrastructure innovation sought by FAIROS. The program's dual-track structure is a perfect fit. He could pursue a 'Disciplinary Improvements' (Track 1) proposal by applying his methods to create a FAIR data commons for a specific application area like Smart Agriculture or Advanced Manufacturing. Alternatively, and perhaps more strongly, he could leverage his core AI expertise to propose a 'Cross-Cutting Improvements' (Track 2) project, such as an LLM-based service for automating FAIR data curation across multiple scientific disciplines. This aligns perfectly with the FAIROS research area tags of 'artificial_intelligence' and 'cyberinfrastructure'.
- **Experience Relevance:** With over $1.2M in funding and 7 successful proposals, the researcher has demonstrated a strong ability to secure competitive funding, particularly from the NSF. His extensive experience with the NSF SBIR program, while focused on commercialization, is relevant in its emphasis on building robust, functional, and sustainable systems—a key goal of FAIROS. The unsuccessful proposals, particularly for programs like POSE (Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems) and PFI (Partnerships for Innovation), are highly valuable learning experiences. They indicate an existing interest in building broader platforms and ecosystems, which is the core spirit of FAIROS. He can learn from the feedback on those proposals to strengthen his FAIROS application.
- **Innovation Potential:** The primary innovation potential lies in applying state-of-the-art AI to the foundational challenges of open science. Instead of incremental improvements, he can propose transformative solutions: 1) An 'XAI-enabled FAIROS' framework where AI models used for research are published with built-in explainability, drastically improving reproducibility. 2) An LLM-powered 'Data Curator as a Service' that can intelligently ingest data from various domains, suggest appropriate metadata standards, and identify potential for interoperability. 3) His entrepreneurial background can lead to innovative sustainability models for the cyberinfrastructure developed, addressing a common weakness in academic CI projects and a specific interest of the FAIROS program.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The POSE program's focus on Open-Source Ecosystems is philosophically very close to FAIROS. The core concepts from this proposal about building and sustaining a community around an open-source tool can be directly repurposed. The strategy is to replace the specific POSE tool with a FAIROS-centric one (e.g., a data commons or curation toolkit) and strengthen the plan for socio-technical governance and broad scientific adoption.
  - Reusable Elements: Community engagement plans, governance models, sustainability strategies, and arguments for the importance of open platforms.
- **RecommendationSystem-NSF21_PFI_Auto_GNN.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal can be reframed from a 'recommendation system' to a 'research discovery engine'. Instead of recommending products, the system would recommend datasets, software, and publications to researchers, directly enhancing the 'Findable' and 'Reusable' aspects of FAIR. The technical core using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is perfect for modeling the complex relationships between diverse research assets.
  - Reusable Elements: The core GNN architecture, arguments for automated relationship discovery, and the technical implementation plan for a large-scale graph-based system.
- **NIH LLMs.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Generalize the approach. Take the core methodology of applying LLMs to a specific data problem (in this case, likely biomedical) and propose it as a cross-cutting FAIROS tool. The adaptation would involve demonstrating how the same LLM techniques could be applied to other domains (e.g., environmental science, materials science) by using flexible, ontology-aware fine-tuning.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical description of the LLM architecture, the fine-tuning process, and the evaluation metrics for the model's performance on data-related tasks.

**Strategic Positioning:** The most effective strategy is to choose the 'Cross-Cutting Improvements' track and frame the project as 'AI-Powered FAIROS'. This leverages his strongest and most unique expertise (LLMs, XAI) and has the highest potential impact. The proposal narrative must pivot away from commercial language (e.g., 'product', 'market') and towards academic infrastructure language (e.g., 'platform', 'service', 'community resource', 'sustainability'). He must explicitly address the socio-technical aspects by forming a team with collaborators from data science, library science, and at least one or two scientific domains to act as test cases. His entrepreneurial experience should be presented as a unique strength in designing a viable long-term sustainability and governance plan for the proposed cyberinfrastructure.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a credible, multi-disciplinary team that includes data curators, domain scientists, and CI experts to address the program's socio-technical requirements.
- Clearly articulating a transformative vision for how advanced AI (LLMs, XAI) can solve core FAIROS challenges, supported by a robust technical plan.
- Leveraging the 'academic entrepreneur' profile to propose a compelling and detailed sustainability plan that ensures the long-term viability and adoption of the developed infrastructure beyond the grant period.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The researcher's heavy focus on SBIR grants may create a perception of being primarily commercially oriented. He must proactively counter this by demonstrating a genuine commitment to open science principles and community building throughout the proposal.
- The profile lacks explicit experience with data stewardship, metadata standards (e.g., Dublin Core, DDI), or digital preservation. This is a critical gap that must be filled by bringing on experienced collaborators.

Furthermore, his work in 'IoT', 'Edge AI', and 'Energy Harvesting Systems' is ideal for developing smart monitoring and control systems for hydrogen production (electrolyzers), storage, and distribution infrastructure. 'Explainable AI (XAI)' is particularly valuable for safety-critical energy applications.
- **Research Domain Match:** While the opportunity's domain is 'Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies', Dr. Reyes's domains of 'Computer Science', 'Engineering', and 'Machine Learning' are the foundational enabling technologies for modernizing this sector. His stated interest in 'Clean Energy' provides a direct thematic link. The proposal should frame his CS/ML expertise as a critical tool to solve key challenges in the hydrogen value chain, making the domain match very strong in an applied context.
- **Experience Relevance:** His experience is exceptionally relevant. As a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with numerous successful SBIR grants (e.g., NSF23_SBIR_ph2), he has a demonstrated track record of bridging academia and industry. This is the core spirit of the Hydrogen INTERN program. His background suggests he has existing industry connections that could serve as hosts for the internship, or the ability to forge such partnerships effectively. His funding success indicates a high level of competitiveness and an understanding of NSF's expectations for both technical merit and broader impacts.
- **Innovation Potential:** The innovation potential is significant. Dr. Reyes can propose projects that apply cutting-edge AI to the hydrogen industry. For example, a student intern could develop an 'Edge AI' system for real-time fault prediction on a fuel cell stack, or use 'Computer Vision' to create a novel, automated quality control process for electrolyzer manufacturing. This moves beyond traditional materials science or chemistry research and introduces a high-tech, data-driven approach to improving the reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness of hydrogen technologies.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF23_SBIR_ph2_ProjectDescription.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is likely the basis for an active award. The supplemental funding request should not adapt the proposal, but build upon it. The strategy is to propose an internship where a graduate student applies the core technology from this Phase II project (e.g., advanced manufacturing AI) to a specific challenge at a non-academic partner in the hydrogen sector (e.g., a fuel cell manufacturer). The narrative should focus on the student's project, the learning objectives, the mentorship plan at the host organization, and how this experience contributes to the hydrogen workforce.
  - Reusable Elements: From the parent SBIR proposal, reuse the description of the core AI/ML technology, the PI's and team's qualifications, and the project's commercialization goals. These elements establish the foundation and credibility upon which the new, hydrogen-focused internship project is built.
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Similar to the above, if this is the active award, the strategy is to frame an internship that deploys the 'AutoML on-device AI' technology for hydrogen applications. An ideal project would involve a student working with an industry partner to implement and validate these on-device models for monitoring remote hydrogen infrastructure or onboard fuel cell systems, emphasizing low-power and real-time analysis.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections describing the AutoML and On-Device AI platform are directly reusable. The sections on broader impacts can be augmented to specifically include workforce development for the clean hydrogen economy.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal must be positioned as a direct response to the national priority of building a clean hydrogen economy. The strategy should be to: 1) Explicitly state which active NSF award this supplement will attach to. 2) Secure a strong letter of collaboration from a compelling non-academic host (e.g., a leading fuel cell company, a national lab like NREL, a hydrogen utility). 3) Clearly define a student project that provides a unique, hands-on R&D experience that leverages the parent grant's technology to solve a real-world hydrogen industry problem. 4) Emphasize the career development benefits for the student and the value of the academic-industrial collaboration.

#### Success Factors
- Possession of an active NSF award to which this supplement can be attached. This is a strict eligibility requirement.
- A well-defined internship project with a committed non-academic partner, detailed in a strong letter of collaboration from the host.
- A clear and compelling narrative that connects the technical work of the parent grant to a significant challenge or opportunity in the hydrogen and fuel cell sector.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Eligibility Confirmation: The single most critical challenge is confirming Dr. Reyes has a current, active NSF award. Without one, he is ineligible to apply for this supplemental funding.
- Demonstrating Hydrogen-Specific Context: While his technical skills are applicable, Dr. Reyes must convincingly demonstrate an understanding of the specific problems within the hydrogen domain. He will need to work closely with the industry partner to frame the problem statement accurately and show that his AI/ML solution is not just a generic application, but is tailored to the nuances of fuel cell or hydrogen systems.

His specific application areas, such as Smart Agriculture, Clean Energy, and Manufacturing, also align with NSF's strategic priorities, allowing for a compelling and impactful theme for an REU Site.
- **Experience Relevance:** Strong, but with a need for reframing. His success in securing over $1.2M in funding, including from NSF, demonstrates a proven ability to navigate the NSF system. His likely experience with the NSF SBIR program is a double-edged sword: it validates his technical and project management skills but is philosophically different from the REU program's educational focus. His unsuccessful proposals for programs like ExLENT and PFI are actually valuable experiences, as they likely provided feedback on broader impacts and partnership-building, which are central to the REU program. A key task will be to explicitly document and highlight his direct experience mentoring undergraduate and graduate students.
- **Innovation Potential:** High. Dr. Reyes can propose a uniquely compelling REU Site. His 'Academic Entrepreneur' profile allows him to frame an experience that goes beyond a traditional lab setting. An innovative theme like 'AI for Social Good: From Research to Real-World Impact' or 'The Entrepreneurial Researcher: Building Trustworthy AI Systems' could leverage his expertise in both fundamental research and technology commercialization, offering students a rare and valuable perspective.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

Another innovative angle is applying his digital watermarking and IP protection expertise to ensure data privacy and security for community-generated data, a critical aspect of smart community governance. The application of his AutoML for Edge AI to a specific community challenge (e.g., optimizing public transit or managing water resources) would represent a significant research contribution.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal's core technology (AutoML on Edge AI devices) is a perfect platform for an S&CC project. The strategy is to shift the application from a general industrial tool (as in SBIR) to a specific, co-designed community solution. Partner with a municipality or community group to identify a key challenge—such as real-time water quality monitoring, hyperlocal air quality alerts, or traffic flow optimization—and frame the AutoML technology as the core research component enabling an adaptive, intelligent solution to that specific problem. The focus must move from commercial potential to scientific advancement and community benefit.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical description of the AutoML framework, the architecture for on-device deployment, low-power considerations, and performance benchmarks can be reused. The 'Broader Impacts' section must be completely rewritten to focus on community engagement, well-being, and workforce development within the community.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Re-contextualize 'Remote Asset Monitoring' from industrial assets to public infrastructure critical to community function. This could include monitoring the structural health of bridges, the operational status of public water pumps, or the performance of a community microgrid. The 'Outlier Detection' research becomes a tool for predictive maintenance, enhancing public safety and resource reliability. The proposal must be framed around a partnership with the community's public works department or equivalent civic institution.
  - Reusable Elements: The core algorithms for outlier and anomaly detection, the system architecture for data ingestion and analysis, and the discussion on sensor data can be adapted. The 'Intellectual Merit' would be reframed around the unique challenges of applying these algorithms to complex, noisy public data streams.

**Strategic Positioning:** The winning strategy is to **lead with the community, not the technology**. Dr. Reyes must identify and form a genuine partnership with a specific community (e.g., a small town, a specific urban neighborhood, a tribal community) *before* writing the proposal. The proposal narrative must be built around this partnership, starting with the community's story and their co-identified challenges. Dr. Reyes' technical expertise should be presented as the innovative research engine to solve that problem. He should leverage his 'Academic Entrepreneur' status to argue for the solution's potential long-term sustainability and impact beyond the grant period, and build an interdisciplinary team including social scientists or community engagement experts to demonstrate a holistic approach.

#### Success Factors
- Forging a genuine, documented partnership with a community stakeholder group to co-define the research problem and goals. This is non-negotiable for S&CC.
- Clearly articulating the 'use-inspired basic research' contribution: how the project advances fundamental science in areas like Edge AI or anomaly detection *through* the process of solving a real-world community problem.
- Assembling an interdisciplinary team that includes expertise beyond engineering, such as sociology, urban planning, or public policy, to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the socio-technical system.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Lack of demonstrated experience in community-led research. The profile is heavily tech-centric, while S&CC demands a socio-technical approach. He must proactively build this experience and team to be competitive.
- Shifting the proposal's value proposition from commercialization (SBIR/PFI) to community well-being and scientific advancement (S&CC). The metrics for success are different, and the proposal must reflect the S&CC program's specific priorities, such as equity, governance, and trust.

The EPCN program's explicit mention of 'energy', 'cybersecurity', and 'engineering_technology' as research areas are all present in Dr. Reyes's profile, making for a natural fit.
- **Experience Relevance:** As a Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur with significant funding success ($1.2M+), Dr. Reyes has demonstrated the ability to secure competitive funding. His experience with NSF SBIR proposals (inferred from filenames) indicates familiarity with the NSF system, although the focus is different. The EPCN program, being a core research opportunity, seeks fundamental scientific contributions rather than commercial products. Dr. Reyes's challenge and opportunity is to leverage his entrepreneurial mindset to frame his research in terms of its transformative potential and broad societal impact, while grounding the proposal in foundational research questions, hypotheses, and methodologies appropriate for a core NSF program, not an SBIR.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. Dr. Reyes can propose novel research by combining his distinct areas of expertise. For example, he could propose developing novel Edge AI and XAI techniques for decentralized, real-time control and cybersecurity in microgrids, powered by integrated energy harvesting systems. Another innovative angle could be the application of watermarking and LLMs for ensuring the integrity and provenance of control signals and operational data in a networked power grid, directly addressing 'Power Grid Cybersecurity' and 'dynamic resource allocation' in a novel way.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the application from 'Remote Asset Monitoring' in a general sense to a specific EPCN context, such as 'Monitoring, Protection and Resilient Operation of Grid'. The core 'Outlier Detection' methodology can be reframed as a fundamental investigation into detecting sophisticated, low-and-slow cyber-physical attacks on the power grid. Emphasize the development of new algorithms for stochastic and dynamic systems, rather than the application itself.
  - Reusable Elements: The core machine learning algorithms for outlier/anomaly detection, system architecture for remote monitoring, and preliminary data showing the efficacy of the detection methods can be reused.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal must be fundamentally transformed from a commercial (SBIR) to a scientific (core) focus. The research question should shift from 'how to build a tool for AutoML on devices' to 'what are the theoretical limits and foundational principles of real-time learning and adaptation on resource-constrained devices within a dynamic power system?' Connect the 'OnDeviceAI' concept to EPCN's interest in 'distributed control and optimization' for networked systems like microgrids or EV charging networks.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical approach for on-device learning, discussion of low-power hardware constraints, and the vision for deploying AI at the edge are all highly reusable as foundational context.

**Strategic Positioning:** The most competitive strategy is to frame a proposal at the intersection of EPCN's 'Energy and Power Systems' and 'Learning and Adaptive Systems' thrusts. The narrative should highlight a critical challenge in modern power systems (e.g., ensuring stability with high renewable penetration, or securing distributed energy resources) and propose a novel, learning-based solution grounded in fundamental research. Dr. Reyes should strongly consider collaborating with a researcher who has deep expertise in power systems control theory or grid modeling. This would mitigate his potential gap in traditional power engineering and create a more compelling, interdisciplinary proposal that speaks directly to the core concerns of the EPCN program directors.

#### Success Factors
- Strong and direct alignment of technical expertise in Edge AI, ML, and energy harvesting with the explicit interests of the EPCN program.
- Proven ability to secure competitive funding from the NSF, demonstrating strong grant-writing skills and an understanding of the agency's goals.
- The proposed research area is high-impact and timely, addressing critical national needs in grid modernization, cybersecurity, and renewable energy integration.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Shifting from an applied/commercialization mindset (evident from SBIR and entrepreneurship focus) to the fundamental research framework required by a core NSF program like EPCN. The proposal must prioritize the creation of generalizable knowledge over a specific product or service.
- The researcher profile lacks explicit, deep experience in core EPCN topics like 'Control Systems', 'Power Electronics', or 'Grid Integration' modeling. The proposal will be significantly strengthened by demonstrating this expertise, either through a collaborator or by thoroughly grounding the proposed work in the existing literature of that domain.

### 66. Computer and Information Science and Engineering : Core Programs (Score: 75)

**Program ID:** 505667  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** While the researcher's technical expertise in AI/ML is an excellent fit for the CISE Core Programs, his demonstrated funding success in commercialization-focused programs (SBIR/PFI) requires a significant strategic pivot towards foundational research to be competitive.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise shows outstanding alignment with the CISE Core Programs. His skills in Anomaly/Outlier Detection, Large Language Models (LLMs), Explainable AI (XAI), and Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI) are a direct match for the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS), particularly the Robust Intelligence (RI) program. Furthermore, his work in IoT, low-power electronics, and computer vision could be framed for the Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS), specifically the Computer Systems Research (CSR) program. The breadth of his expertise allows for multiple potential entry points into this broad solicitation.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are the central focus of the CISE directorate. This is a perfect match. His application-focused areas like Manufacturing, Smart Agriculture, and Clean Energy can serve as compelling use-cases to motivate the need for new foundational research, provided the proposal's core is the fundamental science, not the application itself.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's experience is a double-edged sword for this opportunity. Securing over $1.2M in funding demonstrates a strong capacity for grant writing and project management, which is a significant positive. However, the successful proposals appear to be from NSF's SBIR program (e.g., `NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf`), and the unsuccessful ones from translational programs like PFI and POSE. These programs prioritize commercialization and direct societal impact, whereas the CISE Core program's primary evaluation criterion is 'Intellectual Merit'—the potential to advance fundamental knowledge within the field. This history presents a risk that reviewers may perceive his focus as too applied for a core program. He must explicitly demonstrate a shift in focus to succeed here.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The intersection of LLMs, watermarking for IP protection, and XAI is a frontier research area. A proposal could explore foundational questions such as: What are the theoretical trade-offs between robustness, imperceptibility, and information capacity in generative model watermarks? How can we develop novel, provably secure watermarking algorithms for LLMs? How can XAI techniques be used to validate the integrity of such watermarks? These are fundamental research questions that fit perfectly within the CISE Core mission and build directly on his expertise.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Transform this translational proposal into a foundational one. Instead of focusing on the 'Remote Asset Monitoring' application, pivot to the core scientific challenge. The project should investigate novel, fundamental algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection in high-dimensional, non-stationary data typical of IoT systems. Frame the research around creating new theory or algorithms that are more robust, efficient, or explainable than the current state-of-the-art, using remote asset monitoring as a motivating example rather than the end-goal.
  - Reusable Elements: The literature review on outlier detection, the description of data characteristics (high-dimension, non-stationary), and the preliminary technical approach for the core algorithm can likely be reused and expanded upon. The team's expertise and the problem motivation are directly transferable.
- **NSF21_PFI_Auto_GNN.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Refocus this proposal from an 'Auto_GNN' tool to a fundamental investigation into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Potential research questions could include: developing new foundational GNN architectures that require less labeled data, creating a theoretical framework for explaining GNN decisions (XAI for GNNs), or designing GNNs that are provably robust to adversarial attacks on graph structure. The 'Auto' aspect could be framed as a scientific investigation into automating hyperparameter discovery in novel GNN architectures.
  - Reusable Elements: The sections on GNN fundamentals, literature review, potential architectures, and descriptions of graph-based problem domains are reusable. The core idea can be deepened by focusing on a single, challenging scientific aspect of GNNs.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to target the **IIS Division's Robust Intelligence (RI) program** with a **'Small Projects'** proposal (up to $600k for 3 years). The proposal narrative must be meticulously crafted to emphasize the creation of new computer science knowledge. The 'Academic Entrepreneur' background should be channeled into the 'Broader Impacts' section, highlighting potential for future technology transfer and training students with valuable skills, but the 'Intellectual Merit' section must be purely focused on the fundamental research contribution. A well-defined, executable Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) plan is non-negotiable and must be included as a supplementary document.

#### Success Factors
- Successfully reframing a compelling application-driven problem into a fundamental research question that advances the state of knowledge in AI/ML, aligning with the 'Intellectual Merit' criterion.
- Clearly targeting a specific core program (e.g., IIS:RI or CNS:CSR) and using its language and stated interests in the proposal narrative to show a deep understanding of the program's scope.
- Developing a rigorous and verifiable Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) plan, as this is a required and reviewed component of all CISE Core proposals.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **Mindset Shift from Commercialization to Foundational Research:** The researcher's track record (SBIR, PFI) indicates a primary focus on translational work. He must convince reviewers—who are typically academic peers focused on basic science—that he can lead a project whose main goal is knowledge creation, not product development.
- **Demonstrating Foundational Impact:** A successful CISE Core proposal must articulate how the work will change the field of computer science. The researcher needs to move beyond demonstrating that a technology works and explain *why* it works from a theoretical or algorithmic standpoint, and how the new understanding enables future research.

### 67. Research on the Science and Technology Enterprise: Indicators, Statistics, and Methods (Score: 75)

**Program ID:** 5265  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match if the researcher's advanced AI/ML expertise is strategically pivoted from industrial applications to address the specific statistical and methodological challenges of the S&T enterprise, requiring a new focus on public-sector data and collaboration with domain experts.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's expertise in Large Language Models (LLMs), Explainable AI (XAI), and Anomaly/Outlier Detection is highly aligned with the opportunity's goals. NCSES is explicitly seeking improved methodologies for analysis, alternate data sources, and innovative communication. LLMs can be used to analyze vast unstructured datasets (e.g., publications, patents, grant proposals) to create novel S&T indicators. XAI is critical for this context, as any new statistical model used by a federal agency must be transparent and interpretable for policymakers. Anomaly detection can identify emerging research trends or data quality issues in NCSES surveys, directly supporting their mission.
- **Research Domain Match:** While the researcher's core domains of Computer Science and Machine Learning are relevant, his application domains (Manufacturing, IoT, Energy) are not a direct match for the S&T enterprise statistics focus of NCSES. The opportunity's subject matter is the science of science itself—its funding, workforce, and outputs. To bridge this gap, the researcher must frame his work as applying CS/ML methods to solve problems in scientometrics, survey methodology, and S&T policy analysis, rather than industrial processes. The listed research area 'artificial_intelligence' is a direct link, but must be applied to the NCSES context.
- **Experience Relevance:** Dr. Costilla Reyes has a proven track record of securing significant federal funding ($1.2M+), demonstrating strong proposal writing skills. However, his experience appears heavily weighted towards SBIR proposals, which emphasize commercialization. This NCSES opportunity is a standard research grant focused on intellectual merit and broader impacts for public good. He must adapt his framing from 'market potential' to 'advancing public knowledge and federal statistical practice.' His role as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' is a strength if positioned as bridging cutting-edge research to practical application for a government agency.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. Federal statistical agencies like NCSES are often cautious in adopting new methods. A proposal that convincingly demonstrates how state-of-the-art AI can create more timely, granular, and insightful indicators of S&T activity—while ensuring trustworthiness through XAI—would be highly innovative. For example, he could propose using LLMs to create a real-time map of emerging interdisciplinary fields or to develop a natural language interface for exploring NCSES's complex datasets, directly addressing the goal of 'innovative ways to communicate S&T statistics'.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NIH LLMs.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is the most promising starting point. Pivot the application domain from healthcare (NIH) to the Science & Technology enterprise (NCSES). The core problem statement should change from a biomedical challenge to a challenge in measuring S&T activity, e.g., 'tracking the diffusion of AI techniques across scientific disciplines.' The target datasets would switch from biomedical literature/data to NCSES surveys, USPTO patent data, and open publication databases (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus).
  - Reusable Elements: The technical methodology section on LLM architecture, pre-training/fine-tuning strategies, and text analysis pipelines. The literature review on the application of large language models for knowledge extraction can be adapted with a focus on scientometrics.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Adapt the core concept of 'outlier detection' from 'monitoring remote physical assets' to 'detecting anomalous trends in the S&T enterprise.' Instead of finding faulty equipment, the system would find outlier data points in S&T workforce statistics, unusual funding patterns, or unexpectedly rapid growth in a niche research area. This directly addresses the need for 'strengthen[ing] methodologies to analyze S&T statistical data.'
  - Reusable Elements: The algorithmic framework for anomaly/outlier detection, the mathematical formalization of the problem, and the evaluation metrics for model performance. The section describing the technical approach to data processing and feature engineering could be repurposed for S&T datasets.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal must be positioned as a partnership to help NCSES modernize its capabilities. The strategy should be to lead with an NCSES problem, not an AI solution. For instance: 'Current S&T indicators, based on biennial surveys, have significant latency. This project develops a novel framework using LLMs and XAI to generate near-real-time indicators of workforce mobility and emerging technology clusters from public data, supplementing and enriching existing NCSES reports.' Emphasize how XAI will ensure the methods are transparent and trustworthy for federal use. Explicitly name NCSES datasets (e.g., Survey of Earned Doctorates) and reports (e.g., 'Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in S&E') to demonstrate a deep understanding of their mission.

#### Success Factors
- Forming an interdisciplinary team by collaborating with a sociologist, public policy expert, or scientometrician who has experience with S&T indicators and federal statistics. This closes the domain knowledge gap.
- Centering the proposal on Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle, reassuring reviewers that the proposed methods are not 'black boxes' and are suitable for a public statistical agency.
- Clearly demonstrating how the proposed research will directly support the creation, improvement, or dissemination of NCSES products, such as the Science and Engineering Indicators report.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Demonstrating subject-matter expertise. The researcher's profile lacks experience in scientometrics, survey methodology, or the sociology of science. This must be mitigated, ideally through a strong collaborator.
- Shifting from a commercialization-oriented mindset (SBIRs) to a foundational research and public-good framework (standard NSF grant). The proposal's 'Broader Impacts' section must focus on benefits to policymaking, research, and public understanding, not on building a product.

### 68. Joint National Science Foundation and United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture Funding Opportunity: Supporting Foundational Research in Robotics (FRR) (Score: 75)

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match, leveraging the researcher's deep expertise in AI/ML and Edge AI for agricultural challenges, but success is contingent on framing the work as foundational robotics research and securing a collaborator from the agricultural sciences.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is highly aligned with the 'brains' of a potential agricultural robotics project. Skills in 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)', 'Computer Vision in Manufacturing', and 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' directly map to key challenges in agricultural robotics, such as in-field pest/disease identification, autonomous navigation, and yield estimation on low-power platforms. His work in 'Low-power electronics' and 'Energy Harvesting Systems' is also critically relevant for creating autonomous robots that can persist in the field. While his expertise seems more focused on perception and decision-making (AI/software) than physical manipulation or robot hardware design, this aligns well with the FRR program's focus on pioneering new capabilities in perception and autonomy.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are a perfect fit for the NSF side of this joint opportunity. The explicit inclusion of 'Smart Agriculture Technologies' in his expertise indicates a pre-existing interest and likely some domain knowledge, which is a significant advantage. The opportunity's goal is to fund research at the intersection of robotics and agriculture, making his profile a natural fit. The primary task will be to deepen the connection to a specific, pressing agricultural problem, which is where a collaboration becomes essential to satisfy the USDA/NIFA reviewers.
- **Experience Relevance:** With over $1.2M in funding and 7 successful proposals, the researcher is an experienced and credible PI. His success with the NSF SBIR program demonstrates an ability to write compelling proposals for the NSF and to connect research to real-world impact. However, this is also a point of caution: this DCL calls for *foundational* research via the FRR core program, not the applied/commercialization focus of an SBIR. He must adapt his framing from 'building a product' to 'answering a fundamental scientific question in robotics'. His mid-career stage is ideal, as he has a proven track record but is still actively building his core research program.
- **Innovation Potential:** The researcher's unique combination of skills offers high potential for innovation. He could propose novel, resource-efficient Edge AI algorithms that allow robots to learn and adapt to changing crop conditions in real-time, directly in the field. Another innovative angle would be to integrate his Explainable AI (XAI) expertise to build robotic systems that not only detect crop stress but can also explain *why* a certain area is flagged, building trust with farmers. Combining LLMs with computer vision could lead to a system where a farmer can ask a robot natural language questions about the field ('Show me the areas with the worst nitrogen deficiency'), representing a foundational shift in human-robot interaction for agriculture.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal should be reframed from a commercialization narrative (SBIR) to a foundational research narrative (FRR). The core idea should shift from 'creating an On-Device AI product' to 'investigating novel AutoML frameworks that enable robotic platforms to autonomously learn and adapt perception models in unstructured, dynamic agricultural environments'. The agricultural application (e.g., weed vs. crop identification) would serve as the primary use case to motivate and validate the foundational robotics research.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections detailing the AutoML framework, the advantages of on-device processing (low latency, privacy, no cloud dependency), and the preliminary algorithms can be reused. The 'Broader Impacts' section can be adapted to focus on agricultural sustainability, food security, and developing a future workforce at the intersection of AI and agriculture.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful proposal can be repurposed by strengthening its foundational research contribution. The concept of 'outlier detection' is perfect for identifying diseased plants or stressed crop areas. The adaptation should focus on a core research question, such as: 'How can a mobile robot build a model of normalcy for a crop 'in-situ' and use one-shot or few-shot learning to robustly detect and classify anomalous biological stressors?' This moves beyond simple monitoring to foundational questions of robotic learning and perception.
  - Reusable Elements: The system architecture for remote monitoring and the core outlier detection algorithms can be repurposed. The 'lessons learned' from its previous rejection should be analyzed; it likely needs a stronger collaborator from the target domain (agriculture) and a clearer articulation of the novel scientific contribution versus an engineering integration.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is to lead with his strengths in Edge AI and frame the project as 'enabling persistent, intelligent autonomy in agricultural environments'. He must proactively find a collaborator from a university's Plant Science, Agronomy, or Agricultural Engineering department. This partner will ground the project in a critical agricultural challenge (e.g., early detection of a specific blight, precision pollination, non-chemical weed management) and provide credibility for the USDA/NIFA side of the review. Before submission, he should follow the DCL's strong suggestion to contact the USDA/NIFA program director with a one-page summary, co-authored with his new collaborator, to gauge interest and refine the project's scope.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a genuine, interdisciplinary collaboration with a PI from the agricultural sciences to co-develop the research questions and experimental validation plan.
- Clearly articulating a foundational research contribution to robotics (e.g., in perception, learning, or autonomy), using a compelling agricultural problem as the core motivation.
- Highlighting the unique advantages of his expertise in Edge AI and energy harvesting for creating practical, long-duration autonomous robots, a key challenge in real-world agriculture.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The most significant gap is the current lack of a named agricultural science collaborator, which is critical for proposal credibility and for grounding the research in a real, high-impact problem.
- A necessary mental shift is required from his successful SBIR-oriented (applied, commercial) proposal writing style to a foundational research (core program) style that prioritizes fundamental knowledge generation over product development.
- The researcher's profile appears stronger in AI/software than in robotics hardware/mechatronics. The proposal must either be scoped to focus on perception/autonomy that can be tested on an existing platform or he must add another collaborator with robotics hardware expertise.

### 69. NSF-Italian Ministry of Universities and Research Lead Agency Opportunity on Artificial Intelligence (Score: 75)

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is a strong potential match due to the researcher's direct and extensive expertise in Artificial Intelligence, but success is entirely contingent on securing a suitable Italian research collaborator and framing the project around fundamental research rather than commercialization.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned. His skills in core AI areas like Large Language Models (LLMs), Explainable AI (XAI), and Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI) are at the forefront of current AI research. Furthermore, his expertise in Anomaly/Outlier Detection provides a strong foundation for focused, high-impact proposals. These skills directly map to the broad 'artificial_intelligence' research area of the opportunity.
- **Research Domain Match:** The match is perfect. The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are the primary fields this opportunity targets. His experience in applying AI to diverse areas like Manufacturing Quality Assurance, IoT, Smart Agriculture, and Clean Energy provides multiple avenues for crafting a compelling, application-driven research proposal that would be attractive to both NSF and its Italian counterpart.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's experience is a significant asset but requires strategic framing. Securing over $1.2M in funding, particularly from the NSF, demonstrates a proven ability to write successful proposals and manage projects. However, the majority of his successful proposals appear to be SBIRs (Small Business Innovation Research). While this highlights his entrepreneurial acumen, a proposal for this standard/continuing grant opportunity must pivot away from a commercialization focus and emphasize fundamental 'Intellectual Merit' and 'Broader Impacts'.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The researcher can create a groundbreaking proposal by combining his distinct areas of expertise—for example, developing novel, explainable LLMs for resource-constrained IoT devices in smart manufacturing. The collaborative nature of the Lead Agency mechanism itself is a catalyst for innovation, allowing for the fusion of his expertise with the unique skills, datasets, or perspectives of an Italian research group, leading to outcomes that would not be possible otherwise.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technical concept of AutoML for on-device AI is highly relevant and can be adapted. The strategy is to 'de-commercialize' the proposal: shift the focus from creating a marketable product to answering fundamental research questions. For example, 'How can we develop novel, theoretically-grounded AutoML algorithms that are provably efficient and explainable on edge hardware?' The Italian partner could contribute expertise in low-power electronics, formal methods for AI verification, or a unique testbed (e.g., a European manufacturing facility or agricultural site).
  - Reusable Elements: The technical approach, core algorithms, literature review, and preliminary results section can be largely reused. The 'Market Opportunity' and 'Commercialization Plan' sections must be completely replaced with robust 'Intellectual Merit' and 'Broader Impacts' sections that articulate the scientific contribution and societal benefits, including the value of the international collaboration.

**Strategic Positioning:** The absolute first step is to identify and build a relationship with a high-quality research partner at an Italian university or research institution. The proposal must then be framed around a synergistic collaboration where the US and Italian teams bring distinct, complementary expertise. The narrative must clearly state why this specific international partnership is essential for achieving the research goals. The project should be positioned as fundamental research that aligns with a specific core program within an NSF directorate (e.g., CISE/IIS), using the Lead Agency mechanism as the vehicle for collaboration.

#### Success Factors
- Securing a strong Italian research partner with truly complementary expertise, not just overlapping interests.
- Successfully reframing the research narrative from a commercial product (SBIR-style) to a fundamental scientific investigation (standard grant-style), emphasizing novel contributions to the body of knowledge.
- Clearly articulating the synergy of the US-Italy collaboration, detailing how the combined effort will lead to greater scientific impact than if the teams worked separately.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The most critical gap is the lack of an identified Italian collaborator. The entire opportunity is predicated on this partnership, and finding the right partner requires significant networking and lead time.
- The researcher's heavy track record in SBIR funding may lead reviewers of a standard grant to be skeptical of the project's focus on fundamental science. The proposal must be meticulously written to preemptively address these concerns and highlight the profound intellectual merit.

### 70. Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research : Workshop Opportunities (EPS-WO) (Score: 75)

**Program ID:** 503341  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match if the researcher can pivot from a technology-centric SBIR mindset to a broader, collaborative capacity-building strategy, and crucially, if they are based in or partner with an institution within an NSF EPSCoR-eligible jurisdiction.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Excellent. The opportunity explicitly lists 'artificial_intelligence' and 'cyberinfrastructure' as research areas, which are central to the researcher's expertise. His specific skills in Large Language Models (LLMs), Edge AI, Explainable AI (XAI), and cyber-physical systems (IoT, Manufacturing QA) represent cutting-edge topics of national importance, making him a credible technical convener for a workshop.
- **Research Domain Match:** Very Strong. The researcher's applied domains—Smart Agriculture, Clean Energy, Advanced Manufacturing, and Digital IP Protection—are ideal themes for a multi-jurisdictional workshop. These are pressing regional and national challenges where a collaborative, AI-driven approach could be highly impactful and attractive to NSF. A workshop focused on 'Trustworthy AI for Resilient Agricultural Supply Chains' or 'Cybersecure Advanced Manufacturing in EPSCoR Jurisdictions' would align perfectly.
- **Experience Relevance:** Mixed but Promising. The researcher's significant funding success ($1.2M+) demonstrates grant-writing prowess, but it appears heavily concentrated in the SBIR program, which focuses on technology commercialization. This EPS-WO program requires a different focus: community building, strategic planning, and fostering academic-industrial-governmental partnerships. His 'Academic Entrepreneur' profile is a major asset, suggesting an ability to bridge these sectors. His unsuccessful proposals in partnership-focused programs (PFI, POSE) indicate ambition and prior thinking in this direction, which can be leveraged as valuable experience.
- **Innovation Potential:** High. The researcher has the potential to propose a workshop that convenes a unique blend of experts. For example, he could architect a workshop on 'Foundational Models for Regional Economic Development,' combining his expertise in LLMs, entrepreneurship, and applied domains. The innovative angle would be to focus the workshop not just on the technology, but on creating a multi-state roadmap for developing and deploying these AI tools to address specific regional economic and social challenges, directly targeting the formation of a future NSF Regional Innovation Engine proposal.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot from a research project to a strategic workshop. Instead of proposing to *build* an outlier detection system for asset monitoring, propose a workshop to *define the grand challenges and build a multi-state consortium* for AI-driven critical infrastructure monitoring. The focus shifts from 'doing the work' to 'planning the larger, collaborative work'.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement, literature review, and identification of industrial needs/stakeholders from the PFI proposal can be directly reused to establish the workshop's importance and theme. The original project's goals can be repurposed as key discussion tracks for the workshop.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Broaden the scope from a single commercializable technology to a regional capacity-building effort. The workshop theme would not be about a specific AutoML product, but about 'Building a Skilled Workforce and Research Infrastructure for Edge AI across EPSCoR Jurisdictions.' This reframes the core technical idea into a topic that serves the EPSCoR mission.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical background on Edge AI and its potential applications can form the core intellectual merit and justification for the workshop's theme. The commercialization plan's market analysis can be repurposed to identify key industries and stakeholders who should be invited to the workshop.

**Strategic Positioning:** Position the researcher not as the sole technical expert, but as a visionary 'ecosystem builder' and 'facilitator'. The proposal's core narrative must be about convening the right people to plan for a major, center-level proposal (e.g., an NSF Engine or ERC). The strategy should be to: 1) Identify a critical theme (e.g., AI for water resource management) relevant to several EPSCoR states. 2) Form a steering committee with prominent researchers from at least two other EPSCoR jurisdictions *before* submitting the Concept Outline. 3) Explicitly state that the workshop's primary deliverable will be a white paper and a core leadership team for a future multi-million dollar proposal. This directly addresses the strategic goals of the EPS-WO solicitation.

#### Success Factors
- Forge Genuine Multi-Jurisdictional Partnerships: The proposal must demonstrate that this is not a single-institution effort. Securing letters of collaboration and naming steering committee members from multiple EPSCoR states is essential for the Concept Outline.
- Explicitly Target a Future Center-Level Proposal: Clearly articulate that the workshop is a strategic first step towards a specific large-scale NSF opportunity like an ERC, STC, or NSF Engine. This shows an understanding of the program's purpose beyond just a one-off meeting.
- Demonstrate Broad Stakeholder Engagement: The workshop plan must include targeted recruitment and meaningful roles for participants from academia (different institution types), industry, government, and relevant non-profits. The researcher's entrepreneurial background should be highlighted as a key asset for bridging these communities.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- EPSCoR Eligibility is a Critical Gate: The single most important factor is whether the researcher's submitting organization is in an EPSCoR-eligible jurisdiction. If not, the proposal is ineligible. This must be confirmed immediately, or a partner PI from an eligible institution must be found to lead the submission.
- Shifting Narrative from Commercialization to Capacity Building: The researcher's successful track record is in SBIR. He must consciously shift the proposal's language, goals, and metrics away from product development and towards community building, workforce development, and fostering research collaboration, which are the core tenets of EPSCoR.

### 71. EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement : EPSCoR Research Fellows (Score: 75)

**Program ID:** 506125  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is a strong potential match due to excellent alignment in technical expertise (AI/ML, Engineering), but success is critically dependent on verifying EPSCoR jurisdiction eligibility and strategically reframing the researcher's commercialization-focused experience into a compelling narrative about personal research capacity building through collaboration.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is an outstanding match. His skills in 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Large Language Models (LLMs)', 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)', and 'IoT' align directly with the opportunity's specified research areas of 'artificial_intelligence', 'engineering_technology', and 'cyberinfrastructure'. His specific work on anomaly detection, watermarking, and computer vision provides concrete, cutting-edge topics that can form the core of a highly competitive research plan for the fellowship.
- **Research Domain Match:** The research domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are central to the EPSCoR program's goals. His application areas, such as Manufacturing Quality Assurance, Smart Agriculture, and Clean Energy, represent fields of national importance where advancements in AI/ML can have significant impact. This provides a strong basis for arguing the broader impacts of building his research capacity in these domains.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' status fits the target audience of a mid-career faculty member seeking to transform their research trajectory. His impressive funding record ($1.2M+) and 7 successful proposals demonstrate a high level of grant-writing proficiency. However, his experience is heavily weighted towards commercialization-oriented programs like SBIR. While this proves his ability to innovate, he must pivot his narrative from 'market potential' to 'building fundamental research capacity' and 'personal career transformation,' which is the core goal of the EPSCoR Research Fellows program.
- **Innovation Potential:** The innovation potential is extremely high. Dr. Costilla Reyes can propose to take his applied, entrepreneurial successes and explore the fundamental science that underpins them. For example, he could propose to collaborate with a leading research center to develop novel theoretical frameworks for Explainable AI (XAI) in edge devices, or to access unique facilities to design and test next-generation, ultra-low-power hardware for his AI models. This fellowship is the perfect vehicle to bridge his applied work with foundational research, creating a truly transformative experience.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the core technology from a commercial product (SBIR focus) to a fundamental research question (EPSCoR Fellows focus). Instead of proposing to build a commercial-ready system, propose to use the fellowship to collaborate with a world-leading expert to address a key scientific bottleneck discovered during the SBIR project. For example: 'While developing our AutoML on-device system, we discovered fundamental limitations in model compression for real-time anomaly detection. This fellowship will enable me to work with Dr. X at [Premier Host Institution] to develop novel quantization and pruning theories to overcome this barrier.'
  - Reusable Elements: The 'Intellectual Merit', 'Technical Background', and 'Problem Statement' sections can be heavily adapted. The description of the core AI/ML technology, its importance, and the state-of-the-art are all valuable assets that can be repurposed. The 'Commercialization Plan' should be completely replaced with a 'Collaboration and Career Development Plan'.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to frame this fellowship as the critical next step in the researcher's career evolution from an 'Academic Entrepreneur' to a 'Leading Research Scientist'. The proposal should tell a story: 'My success in developing applied AI solutions (evidenced by SBIRs) has brought me to the frontier of scientific knowledge, where further progress requires new fundamental insights and techniques. This collaboration is not about building a product; it's about acquiring the specific skills and knowledge from a premier host institution to tackle these foundational challenges, thereby transforming my research program and enabling me to train the next generation of scientists at my home institution.' The choice of host institution and collaborator must be meticulously justified as uniquely capable of providing this missing piece.

#### Success Factors
- The exceptional alignment between the researcher's cutting-edge AI/ML expertise and the funding opportunity's research areas.
- A proven track record of securing competitive funding from the NSF, which indicates strong proposal development skills.
- A compelling narrative potential of career transformation, leveraging past entrepreneurial success as a springboard for future fundamental research.
- The requirement to include a trainee (student/postdoc) aligns with the broader goals of workforce development, which is a key tenet of EPSCoR.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **CRITICAL ELIGIBILITY GAP:** The researcher's eligibility is not confirmed. He must be a faculty member (or equivalent long-term research staff) at an institution located in an RII-eligible EPSCoR jurisdiction. This is a non-negotiable, foundational requirement that must be verified before any effort is invested.
- **Narrative Pivot Required:** The researcher's proposal history is heavily focused on commercialization (SBIR). He must demonstrate a clear understanding of the goals of this fellowship program and consciously shift his proposal's focus from commercial impact to personal research development, collaborative science, and building capacity at his home institution.

### 72. GROWING CONVERGENCE RESEARCH (GCR) (Score: 75)

**Program ID:** 505637  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** Dr. Reyes's expertise in applying AI to societal challenges like manufacturing and agriculture provides a strong foundation, but a successful GCR proposal will require him to build a deeply integrated, multidisciplinary team that extends far beyond his core engineering domain.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Reyes's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned with the GCR's target areas of 'artificial_intelligence' and 'engineering_technology'. His skills in Large Language Models (LLMs), Explainable AI (XAI), and Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI) represent the cutting edge of AI development. These technologies are powerful enablers for tackling the 'complex problems focusing on societal needs' that GCR aims to address. For instance, his work on Anomaly Detection in manufacturing or IoT for Smart Agriculture directly maps onto compelling societal challenges.
- **Research Domain Match:** The match is strong but incomplete on its own. Dr. Reyes's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning form an excellent technical pillar for a GCR project. However, GCR's central tenet is 'deep integration across disciplines'. A successful proposal cannot be solely an engineering project. Dr. Reyes's profile represents one critical part of a required convergent team. To be competitive, he must integrate his domain with fundamentally different ones, such as social sciences, public policy, economics, or life sciences, depending on the chosen problem.
- **Experience Relevance:** His experience as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with over $1.2M in funding, including successful NSF SBIR Phase I and II awards, is a significant asset. This demonstrates an ability to frame problems, secure competitive funding, and manage projects. The SBIR experience is particularly relevant for identifying a 'specific and compelling problem' with societal impact. However, he must be cautious. GCR is a fundamental research program focused on creating new paradigms, not a commercialization program like SBIR. His challenge will be to leverage his problem-solving mindset while focusing the proposal's core on the generation of new knowledge and integrated research methodologies, rather than a specific product.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential is very high. The true innovation for a GCR proposal would not just be in a novel application of his technology, but in the creation of a new, integrated approach to a grand challenge. For example, he could combine his expertise in XAI and watermarking with expertise from legal scholars and ethicists to develop a new paradigm for 'Trustworthy AI in Critical Infrastructure.' Another avenue could be integrating Edge AI and Smart Agriculture technologies with rural sociology and agricultural economics to co-develop systems that are not only efficient but also equitable and readily adopted by farming communities. The innovation lies in the 'how' of the research—the co-developed frameworks—as much as the 'what'.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technology (Automated Machine Learning for low-power edge devices) is a powerful tool. The strategy is to elevate its purpose from a commercial application (the focus of SBIR) to a foundational element for solving a grand challenge. Frame the project around a 'vexing problem' that AutoML can help solve, but only when deeply integrated with other disciplines. For example, 'Convergent AI for Climate-Resilient Agriculture,' where the AutoML technology is co-designed with plant scientists, climate modelers, and economists to create a new class of predictive models that merge disciplinary knowledge from the ground up.
  - Reusable Elements: The detailed technical description of the AutoML/On-Device AI system, its capabilities, and its low-power advantages. The problem framing around a specific industry (e.g., manufacturing, agriculture) can be used as a starting point for the larger, more complex societal challenge required by GCR.

**Strategic Positioning:** The key to a successful GCR proposal is to pivot from a technology-first to a problem-and-process-first strategy. Dr. Reyes must: 1) Identify a compelling grand challenge that is intractable without deep disciplinary integration (e.g., ensuring food/water/energy security, creating trustworthy public AI systems). 2) Proactively build a team of co-PIs from non-engineering fields (e.g., a sociologist, an economist, a policy expert, an ethicist). 3) Frame the proposal's core intellectual merit around the creation of a new, convergent research paradigm. The central goal should be the development of a shared language, integrated methodologies, and novel theories that emerge from the collaboration, using his technology as a catalyst for this convergence.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a genuinely integrated, multi-disciplinary team with credible PIs from disparate fields (e.g., social sciences, economics, life sciences) who are involved from the initial proposal conception.
- Clearly articulating a bold, specific, and compelling societal grand challenge that unequivocally requires a convergent, not just a multidisciplinary, approach to solve.
- Demonstrating a management plan and research activities that foster deep integration, such as co-mentored graduate students, joint methodology workshops, and the creation of shared conceptual frameworks, proving the 'convergence' is not superficial.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Demonstrating a history of convergent research leadership. His profile, strong in SBIR and tech development, does not explicitly show experience leading the kind of deeply integrated, non-engineering collaborations GCR demands. This gap must be addressed by the strength of the proposed team and the detailed management plan.
- Shifting from a commercialization-oriented mindset (SBIR) to a fundamental research paradigm-creation mindset (GCR). He must ensure the proposal is not perceived as 'SBIR Phase III', but as a bold new research direction where commercialization is a potential long-term outcome, not the primary objective.

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match due to the researcher's deep technical expertise in microelectronics-adjacent fields, but success hinges on reframing his commercialization-focused background into a compelling educational and workforce development project with a robust broadening participation plan.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Excellent. Dr. Costilla Reyes's expertise in low-power electronics, Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI), IoT, and Computer Vision in Manufacturing Quality Assurance is directly applicable to the core technologies driving the microelectronics industry. He can provide authentic, cutting-edge technical content for curriculum development, research traineeships, or hands-on lab experiences, which is a major strength.
- **Research Domain Match:** Moderate but Bridgeable. The researcher's primary domains are Computer Science and Engineering, while the opportunity's explicit focus is 'education'. This DCL, however, is a call for STEM experts to engage in education. Dr. Costilla Reyes fits the profile of a target PI (STEM faculty) perfectly. The key will be to pivot from a purely technical R&D focus to one centered on pedagogical methods, learning outcomes, and student development, effectively bridging his domain to the educational context of the call.
- **Experience Relevance:** High. His success with NSF SBIR grants, while commercially focused, demonstrates an ability to secure competitive NSF funding and manage complex, outcome-driven projects. His role as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' is a significant asset, suggesting strong industry connections that are vital for creating relevant curricula, internships, and pathways to employment for students. His unsuccessful 'NSF23_ExLENT_AutoVideo.pdf' proposal is particularly relevant, indicating a prior effort in experiential learning which can be refined and repurposed for this DCL.
- **Innovation Potential:** Very High. The researcher could develop innovative educational programs that are rare at the university level. For example, a project could focus on 'AI-driven Quality Assurance in Semiconductor Fabrication' using his XAI and computer vision skills, or 'Designing Ultra-Low-Power AI for IoT devices' leveraging his Edge AI expertise. Integrating his entrepreneurship experience could lead to a unique program on 'Tech Commercialization in Microelectronics,' preparing students not just as engineers but as innovators.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF23_ExLENT_AutoVideo.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful Experiential Learning (ExLENT) proposal is the ideal foundation. The core concept of experiential learning needs to be explicitly refocused on the national need for a microelectronics workforce, as stated in the CHIPS Act. The 'AutoVideo' topic should be directly tied to a microelectronics application, such as automated visual inspection of silicon wafers or PCB assembly. The proposal must be heavily revised to include a formal educational research plan (e.g., assessing the impact of the experiential learning on student skills and career choices) and a deeply integrated, non-trivial Broadening Participation plan, likely through a new partnership with a Minority-Serving Institution (MSI) or community college.
  - Reusable Elements: The original proposal's framework for experiential activities, identified industry needs, potential corporate partners, and the core technical concept can likely be reused. The project narrative structure and budget justification can serve as a starting point.
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The technical content of this successful SBIR proposal is perfectly suited for an educational module. The strategy would be to extract the core technology (AutoML for on-device AI) and build a new educational proposal around it. This could take the form of an NSF IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) project to develop and disseminate a new course with hands-on labs, or a component of an NSF NRT (NSF Research Traineeship) proposal for graduate students. The focus must shift from commercial product development to student learning objectives and workforce preparedness.
  - Reusable Elements: The detailed technical description of AutoML and On-Device AI, its applications, the state-of-the-art analysis, and diagrams illustrating the technology can be directly repurposed for the educational content and curriculum materials.

**Strategic Positioning:** The most competitive strategy is to lead a collaborative proposal targeting the NSF IUSE or ATE programs. Dr. Costilla Reyes should be the PI, providing the cutting-edge technical vision and industry connections. He MUST partner with a co-PI from an Education department or with documented expertise in STEM education research to design the assessment plan and pedagogical framework. Furthermore, he should establish a genuine partnership with a community college or an MSI to co-develop the curriculum and serve as a primary site for implementation, making the Broadening Participation plan a central, driving element of the project rather than an add-on.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a transdisciplinary team that pairs his deep technical expertise with a co-PI's proven expertise in educational research and assessment.
- Leveraging his entrepreneurial background and industry connections to create authentic pathways to employment (internships, co-ops, apprenticeships) for students.
- Building the proposal around a central, impactful, and specific Broadening Participation plan that involves deep partnership with MSIs or community colleges to address the equity goals of the DCL.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Lack of a demonstrated track record in education research. The proposal narrative must convincingly address this gap, primarily through the expertise of a strong co-PI and a well-formulated educational research plan.
- Shifting the proposal's focus and language from commercial outcomes (the focus of his SBIRs) to educational and workforce development outcomes. The primary metrics of success must be student learning, retention, and career placement, not market penetration or IP generation.

**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match if the proposal is strategically targeted at the 'Polar Cyberinfrastructure' (PolarCI) sub-program, leveraging the researcher's expertise in Edge AI and IoT to build enabling technologies for Arctic science in collaboration with a domain expert.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise in Anomaly/Outlier Detection, IoT, Low-power electronics, Energy Harvesting, and especially Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI) is exceptionally well-aligned with the needs of the 'Polar Cyberinfrastructure' (PolarCI) and 'Arctic Observing Network' (AON) components of this solicitation. These skills directly address the challenges of deploying intelligent, autonomous, and energy-efficient sensors in the remote and harsh Arctic environment. Proposing novel Edge AI for on-site data processing, anomaly detection for critical environmental events (e.g., permafrost thaw, glacier calving), and energy-harvesting systems for long-term sensor deployment would be a compelling technical contribution.
- **Research Domain Match:** This is the primary area of misalignment. The researcher's domains are Computer Science and Engineering, whereas the solicitation's core focus is on Arctic natural and social sciences. A proposal focused solely on ML/AI technology would likely fail. However, the 'Polar Cyberinfrastructure' program exists specifically to bridge this gap by funding the development of computational tools and systems that enable Arctic research. Therefore, the domain match is strong *with the PolarCI sub-program*, but weak with the overall solicitation's primary scientific thrust. This gap must be filled via collaboration.
- **Experience Relevance:** Dr. Costilla Reyes has a strong track record of securing funding, including from the NSF, which demonstrates an understanding of the NSF's merit review criteria. His experience with SBIR and PFI proposals indicates a skill for framing research in terms of tangible outcomes and impact. However, he will need to shift the narrative from commercialization (SBIR/PFI) to one of enabling fundamental scientific discovery and building community infrastructure, which is the focus of this core NSF program. His unsuccessful PFI proposal on remote asset monitoring is highly relevant and provides a valuable foundation to build upon by adapting it to a scientific, non-commercial context.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is high. Applying state-of-the-art Edge AI, energy harvesting, and autonomous systems to the unique constraints of the Arctic offers significant innovative opportunities. A project could pioneer new methods for real-time, in-situ data analysis that are currently impossible due to power and bandwidth limitations. Furthermore, incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) could build trust and accelerate adoption by Arctic scientists who need to understand and validate the outputs of these complex models for their own research.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful PFI proposal is the ideal starting point. The core technology—outlier detection for remote assets—is perfectly applicable. The adaptation strategy is to completely re-contextualize it. Replace 'industrial assets' with 'scientific sensors and environmental phenomena' (e.g., detecting sensor failure, identifying anomalous temperature spikes in permafrost, or unusual seismic signals). The 'customer' shifts from an industry partner to the Arctic research community. The proposal must be co-developed with an Arctic scientist (e.g., a glaciologist, ecologist, or oceanographer) who will serve as a co-PI and define the scientific problem that the technology will solve. It should be submitted to the 'Polar Cyberinfrastructure' program.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections describing the outlier detection algorithms, the system architecture for remote monitoring, and the methods for on-device processing can be reused almost entirely. The core technical innovation is directly transferable.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Adapt the concept of on-device AutoML to create a framework that allows Arctic scientists to easily deploy and retrain machine learning models on remote sensor platforms without specialized AI expertise. The pitch is not a commercial product, but a scientific tool that accelerates discovery by adapting to changing environmental conditions and new sensor types within the Arctic Observing Network (AON). This would significantly lower the barrier to entry for using advanced AI in field research.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical description of the AutoML framework, the methodology for on-device model training and inference, and performance benchmarks can be reused. The business/commercial sections must be replaced with a plan for community engagement, open-source software dissemination, and integration with the Arctic Data Center.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal must be explicitly submitted to the 'Polar Cyberinfrastructure' (PolarCI) program, which accepts proposals at any time, avoiding the fixed deadlines of the other programs. The central strategy is to frame the project as 'Cyberinfrastructure to Enable Arctic Systems Science'. This requires forging a genuine collaboration with a co-PI from an Arctic science discipline. The proposal narrative should emphasize how the technology will empower researchers within the AON and ARCSS programs, and how the data and models will be managed and shared via the Arctic Data Center, aligning with NSF's open science principles. Downplay the entrepreneurial/commercialization aspects and highlight the project's role in building foundational, reusable tools for the scientific community.

#### Success Factors
- Forge a strong collaboration with a co-PI who is an established Arctic scientist. This is non-negotiable for credibility and grounding the project in a compelling scientific use case.
- Explicitly target the Polar Cyberinfrastructure (PolarCI) program and frame the project as an enabling technology for the broader Arctic research community, particularly the AON and ARCSS programs.
- Thoroughly address all supplementary document requirements, particularly the 'Ethical Considerations' by discussing data co-production or engagement with Arctic and Indigenous communities, even for a technical proposal.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Credibility gap in Arctic science: The PI's profile lacks any experience or publications in environmental, climate, or polar science. This must be mitigated by a strong collaborative team.
- Narrative pivot from commercial to academic: The PI's successful grants are largely in commercialization-oriented programs (SBIR). He must demonstrate the ability to frame a proposal focused on fundamental research enablement, community infrastructure, and open science, which are the hallmarks of a core NSF program.

Key skills like Anomaly/Outlier Detection are fundamental to intrusion detection systems. Watermarking techniques and Digital IP Protection directly address data and model security. His work in Large Language Models (LLMs) is at the cutting edge of cybersecurity research, applicable to threat intelligence analysis, code vulnerability detection, and defending against sophisticated phishing. Furthermore, expertise in IoT, Edge AI, and Explainable AI (XAI) positions him to tackle critical modern challenges in securing distributed, resource-constrained systems and ensuring the trustworthiness of AI-driven security solutions.
- **Research Domain Match:** The match is perfect. The researcher's core domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are the foundational pillars of modern cybersecurity research. The 'cyberinfrastructure' keyword in the opportunity also aligns well with his work in IoT and Edge AI, which involves the security of distributed computing infrastructure.
- **Experience Relevance:** Dr. Reyes has a strong track record of securing over $1.2M in funding, demonstrating his ability to write compelling proposals. His extensive experience with the NSF, particularly the SBIR program, is a significant asset. This indicates familiarity with NSF's proposal structure, review process, and emphasis on broader impacts. However, his success has been concentrated in the SBIR program, which prioritizes commercialization. This DCL facilitates proposals to core research programs, which prioritize fundamental scientific discovery. The 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' profile is a double-edged sword: it shows applied impact, but he must prove he can shift focus to foundational research questions for this type of grant.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for an innovative proposal is very high. A project that combines several of his key areas of expertise would be highly novel and impactful. For example, he could propose developing 'Explainable and Watermarked LLMs for Autonomous Threat Hunting at the Network Edge,' a concept that merges four of his strengths (XAI, Watermarking, LLMs, Edge AI) to address a significant cybersecurity challenge. Another innovative angle could be securing industrial IoT systems in manufacturing by adapting his anomaly detection and computer vision expertise, framing it as a cybersecurity problem for operational technology (OT).

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technology of AutoML for on-device AI is a powerful starting point. The adaptation strategy must pivot from the commercial goal of the SBIR proposal to a fundamental research question. Instead of 'building a product,' the proposal should focus on 'investigating the security vulnerabilities of federated learning for Edge AI' or 'developing novel, resource-efficient cryptographic protocols for securing AI models on IoT devices.' The collaboration with a German partner could introduce expertise in formal methods to mathematically prove the security of the developed system.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical architecture of the on-device AI system, the literature review on Edge AI and machine learning, and preliminary performance data. The 'Intellectual Merit' section needs a complete rewrite to focus on new scientific knowledge, and the 'Broader Impacts' should be expanded beyond commercialization to include workforce development, educational modules, and contributions to open-source security tools.
- **BP_Watermarked_UIUC__RBPC___Altitut_.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal's focus on watermarking should be reframed from purely digital IP protection to a core cybersecurity mechanism. The adaptation could propose using watermarking for AI model integrity verification (detecting poisoning attacks), data provenance tracking in secure supply chains, or as a forensic tool to trace the origin of cyberattacks orchestrated by AI. This aligns directly with cybersecurity trust and verification.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical explanation of the watermarking algorithm, its robustness, and its imperceptibility. The core algorithm can be presented as the foundational technology upon which new security protocols will be built and evaluated.

**Strategic Positioning:** The single most critical action is to identify and establish a partnership with a DFG-eligible German researcher or research group whose expertise is complementary. Ideal partners would specialize in areas like formal verification, cryptography, privacy-enhancing technologies, or network security. The proposal must be jointly conceived and highlight the synergy between the US and German teams. It should be submitted to a core NSF program like Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC), using this DCL as the collaboration mechanism. The narrative must emphasize the creation of new, generalizable scientific knowledge and clearly define the fundamental research questions that the collaborative team is uniquely positioned to answer.

#### Success Factors
- Securing a strong German academic collaborator with complementary cybersecurity expertise, and co-developing a truly integrated research plan.
- Successfully shifting the proposal narrative from a commercialization focus (SBIR) to a fundamental research focus (NSF core programs), emphasizing scientific discovery and intellectual merit.
- Articulating a highly innovative and compelling research vision that uniquely combines the researcher's expertise in AI/ML (LLMs, Edge AI, Watermarking) to solve a grand challenge in cybersecurity.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The most significant gap is the current lack of an identified German research partner, which is a mandatory requirement for this opportunity.
- The researcher's documented funding success is primarily in the NSF SBIR program. He will need to demonstrate to reviewers that he can successfully lead a fundamental research project, which has different metrics for success than a commercialization-focused project.

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match if the researcher forges a strategic partnership with a domain expert in chemistry, as his AI/ML and manufacturing expertise directly aligns with the DCL's call for data-driven, innovative solutions in sustainable processes.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned with the methodological needs of the CAS-SC opportunity. The DCL explicitly calls for 'computational, data science, and experimental approaches' to solve problems in sustainable chemistry. His skills in Anomaly/Outlier Detection, Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI), and Explainable AI (XAI) are directly applicable to optimizing chemical manufacturing processes, enhancing reaction efficiencies, and minimizing waste through real-time monitoring and control. Furthermore, his experience in Manufacturing Quality Assurance and IoT systems provides a solid foundation for developing and deploying these solutions in a practical, industrial-relevant setting.
- **Research Domain Match:** There is a significant but bridgeable gap here. The researcher's domains are Computer Science and Engineering, while the opportunity's core is Sustainable Chemistry. He does not possess the required domain knowledge in chemistry or materials science. However, the DCL strongly encourages interdisciplinary teams spanning exactly these fields (chemistry, engineering, data science). Therefore, his domain is not a disqualifier but a prerequisite for forming a powerful, collaborative team. His work in 'Clean Energy' and 'Smart Agriculture' shows a thematic alignment with sustainability, which can be leveraged in the proposal narrative.
- **Experience Relevance:** His experience as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with substantial funding success, including NSF SBIR awards, is highly relevant. The CAS-SC program aims to foster 'economic opportunities for U.S. manufacturing' and encourages strong academic-industry partnerships (e.g., GOALI, PFI). His track record demonstrates an ability to frame research for translational impact and commercial potential, which is a key evaluation criterion for many of the participating NSF programs. His previous (though unsuccessful) PFI proposals indicate familiarity with a key target program for this DCL.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The researcher can introduce state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques to the field of sustainable chemistry. For example, he could propose using LLMs to mine scientific literature for novel, greener chemical synthesis pathways, apply XAI to elucidate complex catalytic mechanisms for better catalyst design, or develop low-power Edge AI sensors for real-time, in-situ monitoring of hazardous byproducts in manufacturing streams. This fusion of cutting-edge data science with chemistry represents a significant innovative leap.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the application domain from 'remote asset monitoring' to 'chemical process monitoring.' The core methodology of outlier detection is directly transferable. The proposal should be reframed to focus on detecting process deviations that lead to inefficient resource use, product impurities, or the generation of hazardous waste. This requires partnering with a chemical engineer to define the specific process, key parameters to monitor, and the quantitative sustainability impact of improved monitoring.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections describing the outlier detection algorithms, the system architecture for data collection and analysis, and the potential for commercialization can be largely reused. The 'Broader Impacts' section can be adapted to focus on environmental benefits and workforce development in green manufacturing.
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Adapt the On-Device AI/Edge AI framework for the specific context of a chemical manufacturing plant or a bioreactor. The project could propose developing smart, low-power sensors that run ML models at the edge to provide real-time feedback for process control, thereby minimizing energy consumption and maximizing yield of the desired product. The 'customer' would shift from a general industrial user to a chemical company focused on sustainable production.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical core detailing the AutoML pipeline for creating efficient on-device models is reusable. The hardware implementation details, power consumption analysis, and the arguments for the benefits of Edge AI (low latency, data privacy, scalability) are all directly applicable.

**Strategic Positioning:** The key to a successful proposal is to lead with the chemistry problem, not the AI solution. The researcher must first identify a collaborator in a Chemistry or Chemical Engineering department. Together, they should identify a high-impact problem in sustainable chemistry (e.g., upcycling plastic waste, replacing a critical mineral in a catalyst, improving efficiency in biofuel production). The proposal should then be positioned as a solution to this chemical challenge, where the researcher's AI/ML expertise is the enabling technology. The proposal should be submitted to a target program like PFI (leveraging his entrepreneurial background) or CMMI (focusing on manufacturing innovation), and must begin with the title prefix 'CAS-SC: '. The initial concept outline submitted via ProSPCT is a critical first step to get feedback and an invitation from a Program Officer.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a genuine, interdisciplinary team with a Co-PI from Chemistry or Chemical Engineering who can ground the project in a significant sustainability challenge and provide experimental validation.
- Clearly quantifying the proposed sustainability benefits. Instead of general statements, the proposal must include specific metrics like 'a 20% reduction in solvent use,' 'a 15% increase in catalyst lifetime,' or 'elimination of a specific hazardous byproduct.'
- Engaging an industrial partner, even in an advisory role (as an unfunded collaborator), to demonstrate a clear path to translation and economic impact, which is a core goal of the CAS DCL.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The primary challenge is the researcher's lack of a formal background and publication record in chemistry or materials science. He must rely entirely on a collaborator to establish credibility in the application domain, and a superficial partnership will be easily identified by reviewers.
- Successfully adapting his existing AI/ML models for the complexities of chemical data, which can be noisy, high-dimensional, and governed by complex physical laws. This will require a steep learning curve and deep integration with his chemistry collaborator.

**Program ID:** 505322  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match due to the researcher's expertise in anomaly detection, Edge AI, and cybersecurity, but success requires framing the project with significant mathematical rigor and potentially collaborating to fill specific power systems domain gaps.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Reyes' technical expertise aligns very well with the core needs of the AMPS program. His skills in 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' are directly applicable to identifying grid faults, cyber-physical attacks, and equipment failures. 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)' is highly relevant for decentralized control and real-time monitoring of distributed energy resources (DERs) and smart grid components. Furthermore, 'Explainable AI (XAI)' is a critical and highly sought-after capability for critical infrastructure like power systems, where operators must understand and trust algorithmic recommendations. His work in 'Cybersecurity' and 'Digital IP Protection' also directly addresses the security aspect of the call.
- **Research Domain Match:** The alignment is good but has a critical nuance. Dr. Reyes' domains of 'Computer Science, Engineering, Machine Learning' strongly overlap with the opportunity's 'energy' and 'cybersecurity' research areas. However, the program is led by the NSF's Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS). Therefore, while his applied ML skills are relevant, the proposal must emphasize the development of novel 'mathematical and statistical algorithms', not just the application of existing ones. He needs to highlight the fundamental mathematical innovation in his approach.
- **Experience Relevance:** His experience as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with substantial funding ($1.2M+) and a history of successful SBIR proposals is a significant asset. This demonstrates a proven ability to translate research into practical, high-impact applications, which will be highly valued by the DOE partner in this joint program. His unsuccessful PFI proposal on outlier detection suggests he has already thought deeply about related problems, providing a strong foundation to build upon for this new opportunity.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is high. Dr. Reyes could propose novel frameworks combining his expertise areas. For instance: 1) Developing a new class of statistically-grounded, self-supervised anomaly detection algorithms for high-dimensional, streaming grid sensor data. 2) Creating a distributed, federated learning system running on edge devices across the grid for predictive maintenance, enhanced by XAI to provide operators with actionable insights. 3) Applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and correlate disparate data sources (e.g., system alerts, weather data, maintenance logs) to predict cascading failures.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful proposal is the most promising starting point. The core concept of outlier detection for remote assets is a perfect fit. The adaptation strategy is to shift the narrative from the commercialization focus of PFI to the fundamental research focus of AMPS. Deepen the theoretical underpinnings of the outlier detection algorithm, provide mathematical proofs of its properties (e.g., robustness, convergence), and tailor the application directly to power grid assets like transformers or substations, citing specific DOE challenges.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem formulation, system architecture for remote monitoring, data processing pipeline, and preliminary methodology for anomaly detection can likely be reused and significantly expanded.
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Leverage the success of this SBIR proposal to frame a more foundational research project. Propose developing novel mathematical optimization techniques for AutoML specifically designed for the resource-constrained, real-time, and high-reliability requirements of power system edge devices (e.g., protective relays, PMUs). The commercial success story from the SBIR can be used to bolster the 'Broader Impacts' section.
  - Reusable Elements: The core framework for on-device AI, arguments for computational efficiency, and the AutoML pipeline can be adapted. The 'path-to-market' logic can be reframed as 'path-to-deployment' for the DOE.

**Strategic Positioning:** The winning strategy is to propose a project at the intersection of mathematical innovation and practical grid application. The proposal should be explicitly framed to appeal to both NSF/DMS and DOE/OE. This means clearly articulating: 1) The fundamental mathematical or statistical novelty of the proposed algorithms. 2) A clear use-case demonstrating how these algorithms will improve the security, reliability, or efficiency of the US power grid, citing specific DOE objectives. Leveraging XAI as a core component will provide a strong differentiating factor, addressing the critical need for trustworthy AI in grid operations.

#### Success Factors
- Strong technical overlap in highly relevant areas like Anomaly Detection, Edge AI, and XAI.
- Proven entrepreneurial track record (SBIRs, commercialization focus) aligns well with the applied mission of the DOE partner.
- Ability to propose innovative, cross-disciplinary solutions, such as combining Edge AI with XAI for resilient and trustworthy grid control.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- A lack of explicit, deep domain expertise in power systems engineering (e.g., optimal power flow, transient stability analysis, grid modeling). This should be mitigated by citing relevant literature extensively and, ideally, by partnering with a collaborator from that field.
- The proposal must be carefully crafted to highlight profound mathematical/statistical contributions to satisfy the NSF's Division of Mathematical Sciences, moving beyond a purely applied machine learning narrative.

**Program ID:** 505530  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This planning grant is an excellent strategic fit for the researcher to leverage his entrepreneurial mindset and convergent AI expertise to build the large-scale, multi-disciplinary team required for a future full Engineering Research Center proposal, though the current solicitation is expired and this analysis serves as preparation for the next.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned. His skills in Edge AI, IoT, anomaly detection, and manufacturing QA form a strong technical core for a modern, high-impact Engineering Research Center (ERC). The ERC program's emphasis on high-risk/high-payoff research is a perfect match for advanced topics like Explainable AI (XAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to critical engineering systems. His work in low-power electronics and energy harvesting directly addresses the sustainability and feasibility concerns of large-scale IoT deployments, a key engineering challenge.
- **Research Domain Match:** The alignment is perfect. The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are at the heart of the 'convergent research' approach sought by the ERC program. An ERC vision built around the intersection of these fields—for example, 'Cognitive and Resilient Engineered Systems'—would directly address the solicitation's goals. His work inherently bridges the digital (ML, CS) and physical (Engineering, Manufacturing, IoT) worlds, which is the essence of a modern ERC.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's experience is highly relevant and provides a strong foundation, though with a notable gap in scale. His track record with SBIR grants is a significant advantage, demonstrating a proven ability to frame research in terms of societal and commercial impact, a central tenet of the ERC program. His status as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' is an ideal profile for an ERC leader. The main challenge is the scale jump from ~$1.3M in total funding to the >$25M scale of a full ERC. This planning grant is specifically designed to help bridge this gap by providing resources to build the necessary team and vision.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The researcher could propose a visionary ERC theme such as 'Trustworthy AI for Autonomous Manufacturing' or 'Secure and Sustainable Edge Intelligence for Critical Infrastructure.' This would converge his expertise in AI/ML, IoT, and watermarking with other necessary fields like materials science (for new sensors), industrial engineering (for systems integration), social science (for human-machine teaming and trust), and public policy (for standards and regulation). This represents a high-risk/high-payoff endeavor with transformative societal impact, precisely what the ERC program aims to fund.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Elevate the core technology from a product-focused SBIR pitch to a foundational research vision for a multi-faceted ERC. Frame 'AutoML on-device AI' not as a commercial solution, but as a fundamental research thrust within a larger grand challenge, such as enabling the next generation of smart factories or resilient energy grids. The planning grant proposal should describe activities to identify partners and stakeholders who would build upon this core technology (e.g., roboticists, materials scientists, workforce development experts).
  - Reusable Elements: The 'Commercialization Plan' and 'Broader Impacts' sections can be repurposed to draft the ERC's 'Innovation Ecosystem' and 'Societal Impact' plans. The technical background on Edge AI can serve as the starting point for one of the ERC's foundational research thrusts. Customer discovery and market analysis from the SBIR can be used as preliminary evidence of stakeholder needs.

**Strategic Positioning:** Position the proposal around a compelling grand challenge that necessitates a convergent approach. For example: 'An ERC for Resilient and Human-Centered Smart Manufacturing'. This frames the researcher's AI expertise as the central nervous system but explicitly requires partners in robotics, supply chain logistics, cognitive psychology, and workforce education. The proposal narrative should focus less on solving the technical problem and more on the *plan* to build the team, engage a diverse stakeholder community (industry, national labs, community colleges), and co-create the full ERC research roadmap. Emphasize the entrepreneurial experience as proof of ability to manage a complex innovation ecosystem.

#### Success Factors
- Articulating a Grand Challenge Vision: Clearly define a compelling, large-scale engineering problem with profound societal impact that cannot be solved by a single discipline.
- Leveraging Entrepreneurial and SBIR Experience: Explicitly connect past success in technology commercialization to the ERC's mandate for building a dynamic innovation ecosystem that translates research to practice.
- Evidence of Preliminary Team Building: The proposal will be significantly strengthened by identifying a small core of potential senior personnel from diverse institutions and disciplines, demonstrating that the team formation process has already begun.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Demonstrating Leadership at Scale: The primary challenge is to convince reviewers of the capacity to lead a multi-institutional, multi-million-dollar center. The proposal must outline a clear plan for developing the leadership and management structure required for an ERC.
- Building a Genuinely Convergent Team: The researcher's network may be concentrated in CS/ECE. A key challenge, which this grant aims to solve, is identifying and securing tentative buy-in from credible partners in disparate fields like social sciences, education, and public policy, which are critical for a successful ERC.
- Expired Solicitation: The immediate barrier is that this specific solicitation (nsf21-529) is no longer active. The primary action is to prepare this strategic framework to be ready for the moment the next ERC or ERC Planning Grant solicitation is announced by NSF.

This familiarity with NSF's structure, requirements (e.g., Broader Impacts), and review criteria is a significant advantage. His profile as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' is also a strength, as it positions him to articulate compelling pathways for technology transfer and economic impact, which can strengthen the proposal's broader significance.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for an innovative proposal is high. The true innovation enabled by this DCL lies in the synergy of international collaboration. Dr. Reyes could combine his expertise in Edge AI and watermarking with a potential Israeli partner's strengths in areas like specialized hardware design, cybersecurity, or advanced materials. A project on 'Secure and Efficient Federated Learning for IoT using Novel Hardware and Watermarking Techniques,' for example, would be highly innovative and justify the international partnership, as required by the DCL.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This successful SBIR proposal can be repurposed for a foundational research grant within an NSF CISE core program. The strategy is to shift the focus from the commercialization plan to the fundamental scientific challenges of AutoML for resource-constrained devices. The proposal should be reframed to explore novel algorithms, theoretical performance limits, and principles of on-device learning, integrating an Israeli partner's complementary role in, for example, low-power chip design or algorithm validation on unique testbeds.
  - Reusable Elements: The core technical description of the AutoML on-device AI system, preliminary data, literature review, and the PI's biographical sketch and qualifications.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Although unsuccessful, this PFI proposal's topic is excellent for a standard research grant. The adaptation would involve removing the heavy focus on technology translation and instead proposing a deep dive into the fundamental principles of 'Unsupervised Outlier Detection in High-Dimensional, Non-Stationary Time-Series Data.' A collaboration could involve an Israeli expert in statistical signal processing or a specific application domain (e.g., water infrastructure monitoring, a known Israeli strength) to provide data and domain-specific challenges.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement, the overview of the outlier detection methodology, the description of remote asset monitoring as a compelling application area, and the literature review.

**Strategic Positioning:** The optimal strategy is a three-step process: 1) Proactively identify and establish a collaboration with an Israeli researcher whose expertise is complementary, not redundant. 2) Jointly identify a high-priority research problem and select a target NSF program with a suitable deadline and scope (e.g., CISE Core, SaTC). 3) Co-develop a truly integrated proposal where the intellectual contributions of both the U.S. and Israeli teams are clearly defined and shown to be essential for project success. The narrative must explicitly state why the collaboration is critical to achieving the research goals.

#### Success Factors
- Dr. Reyes's research expertise in high-demand AI/ML fields is a direct match for major NSF funding priorities.
- Proven success in securing NSF funding (inferred from SBIR filenames) indicates familiarity with the agency's standards and review process.
- The 'Academic Entrepreneur' profile can be leveraged to craft a powerful 'Broader Impacts' section, addressing economic competitiveness and technology transfer.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The primary challenge is the need to find and secure a committed, eligible Israeli collaborator. This opportunity is non-actionable without one.
- The proposal must be competitive against all other proposals in a standard NSF program, with the added burden of justifying the international collaboration's value. It cannot simply be two separate projects bundled together.
- Much of his apparent success is in translational programs (SBIR/PFI). He will need to ensure the proposal is framed for fundamental research to succeed in a core NSF program, which has different review criteria.

### 80. PFE: Research Initiation in Engineering Formation (PFE: RIEF) (Score: 75)

**Program ID:** 503603  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is a strong potential match as it is specifically designed for experienced engineering faculty like Dr. Reyes to pivot into education research, but success is entirely dependent on strategically reframing his technical and entrepreneurial expertise into a study of engineer formation, rather than a technology development project.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Reyes's deep expertise in AI/ML, LLMs, and IoT is highly relevant not as a tool for the research, but as the *subject* of the research. The professional formation of engineers is being profoundly impacted by these technologies. A project investigating how to ethically and effectively train the next generation of AI-specialized engineers would be timely and directly aligned with the program's goal of addressing 'dynamic workforce needs' and 'national priorities'. His technical background provides the credibility to define what skills and values are critical for students in these fields.
- **Research Domain Match:** The mismatch is the match. The program explicitly targets engineering faculty with 'little or no experience conducting social science or education research.' Dr. Reyes's profile, strong in 'engineering_technology' and 'artificial_intelligence' but with no stated experience in 'education' or 'social_behavioral' research, fits the target audience profile perfectly. This program is the designated on-ramp for researchers with his exact background.
- **Experience Relevance:** His extensive grant success ($1.2M+) demonstrates a proven ability to craft compelling proposals, a highly transferable skill. His background in 'Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization' is a significant asset, as fostering an entrepreneurial mindset is a major theme in modern engineering education. This provides a unique and authentic basis for a research project. His unsuccessful proposal 'NSF23_ExLENT_AutoVideo.pdf' indicates a prior interest in experiential learning, a core concept in engineering formation, which can be built upon.
- **Innovation Potential:** The innovation lies in bridging his world of cutting-edge AI and entrepreneurship with the field of education research. He can propose novel research questions that few others are equipped to ask, such as: 'How does engagement in an AI-focused startup environment shape the ethical framework and professional identity of engineering students?' or 'What pedagogical strategies are most effective for teaching complex socio-technical concepts like Explainable AI (XAI) to undergraduates?' This fusion of deep tech context with social science inquiry is the innovative core of a potential proposal.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF23_ExLENT_AutoVideo.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot from technology creation to educational research. The original proposal likely focused on building an 'AutoVideo' platform for experiential learning. The RIEF proposal should instead propose to *study the impact* of such a platform (or a similar existing one) on student learning. The research questions would shift from 'Can we build it?' to 'What do students learn about teamwork, design, and professional practice when using this type of tool?' The focus must move from the tool to the student's formation.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement regarding the need for better experiential learning; the description of the technical domain (e.g., video projects, manufacturing); and the articulation of desired student learning outcomes can all be repurposed as the context and motivation for the new research-focused proposal.
- **NSF21_PFI_Auto_GNN.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Leverage the theme of university-industry-student collaboration. PFI proposals often detail the benefits of students working on real-world problems with industry partners. This can be adapted into a research project studying that very process. The research could be a qualitative study (interviews, observations) of student teams in a senior design clinic or internship program to understand how their interactions with industry mentors influence their professional values and career aspirations.
  - Reusable Elements: The description of the industry-relevant technical problem (context), the structure of student-industry engagement, and the justification for why this type of experience is valuable for workforce development can be reused to frame the research setting and its importance.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal must be framed as a personal and professional development journey. Dr. Reyes should position himself as an expert engineering practitioner and mentor who has identified critical gaps in engineering education through his own experience (especially in entrepreneurship) and is now seeking the training and mentorship—funded by RIEF—to develop the rigorous social science research skills needed to address them. The narrative should highlight his passion for student development. The central theme could be 'From Engineering Entrepreneur to Engineering Education Researcher: A Study of Entrepreneurial Mindset Formation in AI Engineers'.

#### Success Factors
- Secure a strong Co-PI or Mentor from social sciences, education, or an established engineering education research group. This is non-negotiable and demonstrates the project's methodological rigor and commitment to the program's goal of building research capacity.
- Clearly articulate a pivot from a 'building things' mindset to a 'studying people and processes' mindset. The research questions, methods, and evaluation plan must focus on understanding student formation, not on technology development or assessment.
- Leverage the unique 'Academic Entrepreneur' angle. Frame the research around how to formally instill the values, skills, and mindsets (e.g., resilience, ethics, customer discovery) of technology entrepreneurship into the engineering curriculum.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Demonstrating genuine commitment to education research. Reviewers will be skeptical if the project appears to be a 'Trojan Horse' for funding a technology project that was unsuccessful elsewhere. The proposal must be authentically centered on education research questions.
- Developing a rigorous research methodology. Coming from a technical background, Dr. Reyes must work closely with his education research mentor to propose a credible plan using established qualitative and/or quantitative social science methods (e.g., thematic analysis, validated surveys, case studies), which will be a new domain for him.

- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's primary domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are the central focus of the CISE directorate that issued this DCL. His application areas, such as Smart Agriculture and Manufacturing Quality Assurance, represent data-intensive fields where the establishment of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles and effective data management practices would have a significant impact, making them excellent testbeds for a proposed project.
- **Experience Relevance:** His status as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' is highly relevant. The DCL seeks 'effective practices,' which implies practical, usable, and adoptable solutions. His entrepreneurial focus suggests an ability to develop tools and workflows with real-world utility. A strong track record with NSF, including SBIR proposals, demonstrates familiarity with the agency's goals of fostering both foundational research and its broader impacts, which is the essence of this DCL.
- **Innovation Potential:** The innovation potential is high but requires a shift in perspective. Instead of inventing a new algorithm for its own sake, the innovation would lie in creating novel systems or frameworks that enable better data practices for the scientific community. For instance, he could propose an 'LLM-powered framework for automatically generating FAIR-compliant metadata for distributed IoT sensor data' or 'An open-source toolkit for embedding cryptographic watermarks in ML models to trace data lineage and protect IP,' directly leveraging his unique expertise to solve a community-wide problem.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Refocus this proposal on creating an open-source ecosystem specifically for trusted and reproducible data science. The core idea would be to build tools based on your watermarking, XAI, and outlier detection expertise that enable researchers to share data and models ethically and securely. Frame it as a direct response to the call for 'effective practices' by providing the community with a tangible, open-source platform that embodies these practices. The POSE (Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems) program is an ideal target for this DCL's goals.
  - Reusable Elements: The core concept of building an open-source ecosystem, the description of the target user community (data scientists/ML researchers), and the technical details of the underlying technologies (watermarking, XAI) can be reused and expanded.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Adapt this proposal from a specific application-focused tool to a generalizable 'Framework for Data Quality Assurance in Streaming IoT Environments.' Position outlier detection not as the end-goal, but as a core component of a 'best practice' for ensuring data integrity before it is archived or used for research. The proposal should emphasize how this framework could be adopted by other researchers in the IoT domain to improve the quality and reusability of their data.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem description of managing large-scale, noisy IoT data, the technical details of the outlier detection algorithms, and the use case of remote asset monitoring can serve as a prime example of the framework's utility.

**Strategic Positioning:** The key strategy is to submit a proposal to a relevant, active CISE program (e.g., an IIS Core Program on data management, or a program like POSE) and explicitly reference this DCL (nsf19069) in the introduction. The proposal must be framed not as a narrow technical advancement, but as a service to the research community. It should clearly identify a data-management bottleneck in a specific scientific domain, propose a solution built on your technical expertise, and present a robust plan for community engagement, dissemination, and adoption (e.g., via open-source tools, workshops, tutorials).

#### Success Factors
- Community-Centric Framing: Clearly articulating which research community will benefit from the proposed 'effective practice' and providing evidence of their specific data management needs.
- Tool/Framework Development: Proposing a tangible output, such as an open-source software toolkit, a workflow, or a platform, that operationalizes the proposed data practices.
- Focus on FAIR Principles and Reproducibility: Explicitly connecting the proposed work to how it will make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, and how it will enhance research reproducibility.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- DCL is Not a Standalone Program: A critical challenge is that nsf19069 is a Dear Colleague Letter, not a funding program. A proposal must be tailored to a separate, active NSF program, successfully meeting its criteria while also addressing the themes of the DCL.
- Shift from Application to Infrastructure: The researcher's portfolio seems focused on applying AI to solve problems. This requires a narrative pivot to focus on building the data infrastructure and practices that *enable* others to solve problems.
- Measuring Impact: The impact of a 'best practice' can be harder to quantify than algorithmic performance. The proposal will need thoughtful, well-defined metrics to evaluate the adoption, usability, and effectiveness of the proposed practice or tool.

### 82. Operations Engineering (OE) (Score: 75)

**Program ID:** 505202  
**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is a strong potential match due to the researcher's expertise in applying AI to high-impact engineering domains like manufacturing, but a successful proposal will require a strategic shift from a commercialization focus to advancing fundamental analytical methodologies.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise in 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection', 'Explainable AI (XAI)', 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)', and 'Computer Vision in Manufacturing' aligns well with the OE program's call for 'data science' and 'advanced analytical methods'. These skills are directly applicable to improving operations. The key will be to frame this work not merely as applying existing ML models, but as developing new, fundamental methodologies. For instance, research on XAI could be positioned as a contribution to 'decision and risk analysis' by providing quantifiable explanations for operational choices. Similarly, Edge AI work can be framed as developing novel optimization methods for decision-making under severe computational and energy constraints, a classic operations research challenge.
- **Research Domain Match:** There is an excellent alignment between the researcher's domains and the opportunity's focus areas. The researcher's experience in 'Manufacturing Quality Assurance', 'Clean Energy', and 'Smart Agriculture' maps directly onto the OE program's stated interests in 'production/manufacturing systems', 'energy', and 'environment'. This strong grounding in relevant application domains fulfills the key requirement that methodological research must be 'motivated by problems that have potential for high impact in engineering applications'. This is a significant strength for a competitive proposal.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's successful track record, particularly with NSF SBIR grants, is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it demonstrates a proven ability to identify and articulate high-impact problems with commercial relevance, which resonates with the OE program's application-driven focus. On the other hand, the OE program funds *fundamental research*, not product development. The challenge will be to leverage the compelling application contexts from his SBIR work (e.g., 'AutoML_OnDeviceAI') to motivate fundamental research questions appropriate for OE, rather than proposing applied R&D. His mid-career stage and entrepreneurial background suggest a maturity in identifying impactful problems, which is a plus.
- **Innovation Potential:** The primary innovation potential lies at the intersection of the researcher's expertise in modern AI/ML and the traditional focus of Operations Engineering. He can propose innovative research on: 1) Developing new theoretical frameworks for real-time, explainable anomaly detection in complex manufacturing processes, contributing fundamentally to decision analysis under uncertainty. 2) Creating novel optimization algorithms for designing and deploying robust ML models on resource-constrained IoT networks (Edge AI), directly addressing operational efficiency in distributed systems. 3) Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to formalize and solve complex scheduling or logistics problems described in natural language, creating a new paradigm for human-in-the-loop decision systems.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the proposal's core from developing a deployable tool (PFI focus) to investigating the fundamental scientific challenges of outlier detection in this context (OE focus). The research objective should shift from 'build a system to monitor assets' to 'develop a new mathematical framework for dynamic, multi-modal outlier detection in non-stationary, resource-constrained environments'. The 'Intellectual Merit' section must emphasize the creation of new, generalizable algorithms and theoretical insights, using remote asset monitoring as the motivating, high-impact case study.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem motivation, description of the high-impact application domain (remote asset monitoring), analysis of data challenges, and the literature review on existing detection methods can be largely reused.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Reframe the AutoML problem from a commercial service into a fundamental research problem in 'decision analysis' and 'optimization'. The proposal could investigate AutoML as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty and severe resource constraints. The research could focus on developing novel, provably efficient search algorithms (e.g., based on Bayesian optimization or reinforcement learning) for discovering optimal ML models for operational tasks on edge devices, a core challenge in modern distributed operations.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical background on Edge AI, the motivation for on-device intelligence in manufacturing/IoT contexts, and the analysis of computational constraints are highly reusable components.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal should be positioned as a bridge between cutting-edge AI/ML research and foundational Operations Engineering principles. The narrative must explicitly state how the proposed AI/ML advancements contribute new tools to the OE methodology toolkit (e.g., optimization, decision analysis). The title should reflect this, such as 'Fundamental Advancements in Stochastic Optimization for Real-Time Operational Decision-Making on Edge Devices'. The proposal should clearly define the engineering application (e.g., zero-defect manufacturing), articulate the specific operational decisions involved, and then present the development of new analytical methods as the core research needed to improve those decisions.

#### Success Factors
- Clearly framing the research as a contribution to fundamental analytical methods (e.g., new optimization theory, new stochastic models) rather than just an application of existing AI.
- Deeply and authentically integrating a high-impact engineering application (like manufacturing QA or energy infrastructure monitoring) as the driving motivation for every research question.
- Explicitly using the language of Operations Engineering (e.g., 'optimization', 'stochastic modeling', 'decision analysis') to describe the research, connecting the researcher's CS/AI expertise to the program's core domain.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Overcoming the perception of being an 'application/commercialization' researcher by demonstrating a deep understanding of and commitment to fundamental, theory-building research. The proposal's 'Intellectual Merit' section is critical for this.
- The researcher's profile lacks explicit mention of traditional OE methods like 'stochastic modeling' or 'deterministic optimization'. The proposal must proactively bridge this gap by citing seminal OE literature and showing how the proposed ML methods advance or complement these established techniques. Collaboration with a faculty member from an Industrial/Systems Engineering department could significantly strengthen the proposal.

**Compatibility Score:** 75/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match due to the researcher's deep expertise in AI, IoT, and engineering for instrumentation, but success is entirely contingent on forming a genuine collaboration with an ocean scientist to address the clear domain knowledge gap.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical skills are exceptionally well-aligned with the opportunity's goal of developing novel instrumentation. His expertise in Anomaly/Outlier Detection, IoT, Low-power electronics, Energy Harvesting Systems, and Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI) directly translates to creating next-generation oceanographic sensors. For example, he could propose intelligent, low-power buoys that use Edge AI for real-time anomaly detection in water quality data, or autonomous underwater sensor nodes that use energy harvesting and only transmit data when a specific acoustic or visual event is detected. His work in XAI could also be leveraged to help oceanographers trust and interpret the complex patterns identified by the new instruments.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science and Engineering are a perfect fit for the opportunity's listed research areas of 'artificial_intelligence' and 'engineering_technology'. However, there is a significant and critical gap: a lack of demonstrated experience in 'ocean science'. The program's title explicitly includes 'Interdisciplinary Coordination', meaning this gap must be filled by a strong collaborator. The proposal will not be competitive without a Co-PI from marine science or oceanography who can ground the technological development in a compelling scientific problem.
- **Experience Relevance:** Dr. Costilla Reyes's experience as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with substantial funding success, particularly with NSF SBIR grants (inferred from filenames), is highly relevant. It demonstrates his ability to develop and frame technology with practical, real-world applications. The OTIC program's focus on instrumentation with 'broad applicability' aligns perfectly with this entrepreneurial mindset. Furthermore, his unsuccessful proposal on 'OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring' shows he has already developed core concepts that can be directly adapted to an oceanographic context.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The researcher can introduce cutting-edge Edge AI and autonomous systems to a field that can benefit immensely from them. The innovation would be in creating 'smart' observational tools that can perform analysis in-situ, drastically reducing data transmission needs and power consumption while enabling real-time event detection. This would represent a paradigm shift from traditional 'collect-then-analyze' methods to a new 'sense-and-decide' capability, directly enhancing the 'observational, experimental or analytical capabilities' of the ocean science community as stated in the synopsis.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This proposal should be the foundational template. The core strategy is to replace the 'Remote Asset Monitoring' application with a specific, high-impact ocean science problem. This involves: 1) Partnering with an oceanographer to define the use case (e.g., monitoring coral reef health, detecting harmful algal blooms, or tracking marine mammal acoustics). 2) Replacing the introduction, project motivation, and evaluation sections to reflect the new oceanographic context. 3) Tailoring the technical section to address the specific data types and challenges of the marine environment (e.g., acoustic data, hyperspectral imagery, salinity/temperature data).
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical methodology for outlier detection algorithms, the system architecture for Edge AI processing, the discussion of low-power hardware considerations, and the literature review on anomaly detection techniques can be largely reused with minor modifications.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The concepts from this proposal can be integrated to add another layer of innovation. The idea would be to propose an instrument that not only detects anomalies but also uses AutoML to adapt its detection models in-situ as environmental conditions change. This would create a truly autonomous and adaptive monitoring system.
  - Reusable Elements: The framework and discussion around AutoML, on-device learning techniques, and model adaptation can be integrated into the core proposal to strengthen its technical novelty.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal must be positioned as a technology-enabling-science collaboration, not a computer science project with a marine 'test case'. The narrative should be led by a compelling oceanographic question that is currently intractable with existing technology. Dr. Costilla Reyes's contribution should be framed as the key technological solution that unlocks this new scientific frontier. He should leverage his entrepreneurial experience to emphasize the robustness, scalability, and 'broad applicability' of the proposed instrumentation, making it an attractive asset for the wider ocean science community.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a genuine and deep collaboration with a respected ocean scientist who will be a co-PI and help drive the scientific narrative and validation plan.
- Clearly articulating a vision for a technology platform (not just a one-off tool) that has broad applicability across multiple areas of ocean research.
- Focusing the proposal on the development of a tangible instrument or system that provides a transformative leap in observational or analytical capability, leveraging his unique expertise in Edge AI and low-power systems.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Credibility Gap in Ocean Science: The most significant challenge is the researcher's lack of a track record in oceanography. This must be mitigated by bringing on a strong collaborator who provides the necessary domain expertise, access to data, and a plan for field testing in a relevant marine environment.
- Hardware Development for Marine Environments: Designing and building electronics that can survive the harsh, corrosive, and high-pressure ocean environment is a major engineering challenge. The proposal must convincingly address this, either by partnering with a marine engineer or by detailing a robust plan for materials selection, enclosure design, and testing.
- Shifting Focus from Commercial to Foundational Research: While his SBIR background is a strength, this is a standard research grant. The proposal's primary goal must be to enable new scientific discovery, not to develop a commercial product. The narrative needs to be carefully crafted to emphasize the advancement of research capabilities.

### 84. Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) (Score: 72)

**Program ID:** 5338  
**Compatibility Score:** 72/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is a strong potential match for the TRTech-PGR track if the researcher's advanced AI/IoT expertise is applied to tool development through a strategic partnership with a plant biologist to bridge the significant gap in biological domain knowledge.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise in AI/ML, IoT, and Edge AI aligns exceptionally well with the PGRP's TRTech-PGR track, which explicitly seeks 'innovative tools, resources, and technology breakthroughs.' His skills in Machine Learning at the Edge are directly applicable to developing novel high-throughput phenotyping platforms for in-field data collection and analysis. His experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) could be leveraged to create new tools for mining and synthesizing vast public datasets and scientific literature to generate novel hypotheses. Furthermore, his background in Explainable AI (XAI) directly addresses a critical need in biology: making complex AI-driven discoveries transparent and interpretable for researchers.
- **Research Domain Match:** There is a significant mismatch in core research domains. The researcher's background is in Computer Science and Engineering, while the program's core is Plant Biology and Genomics. However, the PGRP solicitation explicitly encourages transdisciplinary approaches and seeks to fund the development of tools by engineers and computer scientists that can empower the biology community. The researcher's listed domain of 'Smart Agriculture Technologies' serves as a crucial bridge, demonstrating an interest in the application space. The success of a proposal is entirely contingent on framing his work as an enabling technology for plant science, not as a standalone CS/Engineering project.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's status as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with a strong record of securing funding, including NSF SBIR grants, is highly relevant. This experience demonstrates an ability to manage large projects and a focus on creating tangible, usable outcomes ('tools, technologies, and resources') with 'societal and economic importance,' which are key themes of the PGRP. His success with SBIR proposals suggests he can effectively articulate the value proposition and impact of a new technology, a skill that is directly transferable to the TRTech-PGR track.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The researcher can introduce cutting-edge concepts from the tech industry that are not yet widely adopted in plant genomics. For instance, applying his 'AutoML_OnDeviceAI' work to create smart, autonomous sensors for real-time plant stress detection would be a significant leap forward. Similarly, adapting his 'Watermarking techniques' to ensure provenance and integrity of large, federated genomic datasets could be a novel and highly impactful contribution. The fusion of his expertise in LLMs, Edge AI, and IoT systems could create a new paradigm for data collection and discovery in plant science.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This is the most promising foundation. The core concept of 'Automated Machine Learning on-device' should be reframed from its original context (likely manufacturing/industrial) to 'Automated, real-time phenotyping and stress detection in plants using Edge AI.' The proposal would describe a system of low-power sensors (leveraging his IoT expertise) deployed in a field or greenhouse, where on-device AI models automatically identify and classify plant traits or early signs of disease/drought stress, addressing a key bottleneck in connecting genotype to phenotype.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical architecture for on-device model training and inference, algorithms for model compression (e.g., for low-power microcontrollers), and the overall framework for automating the machine learning pipeline.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Although unsuccessful, the core idea is adaptable. 'Outlier Detection in Remote Assets' can be repurposed as 'Anomaly Detection in Plant Systems for Pre-symptomatic Stress Discovery.' Instead of monitoring industrial machines, the system would monitor sensor data (e.g., hyperspectral, thermal, moisture) from crops to identify subtle deviations from normal physiology that precede visible symptoms. The proposal must clearly state the biological question this would answer, e.g., 'Can we identify novel spectral signatures that are early indicators of nitrogen deficiency?'
  - Reusable Elements: The fundamental algorithms for unsupervised outlier/anomaly detection, the data-handling architecture for remote sensor streams, and the justification for why remote monitoring is critical.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal must be submitted to the **TRTech-PGR Track** and built around a strong, authentic collaboration. The PI should proactively seek a partnership with an established plant biologist or geneticist who can serve as a co-PI. The proposal narrative should be led by the biological challenge (e.g., accelerating breeding for climate resilience), with the researcher's technology presented as the transformative solution. The budget and project plan must reflect a deep integration between the technology development (led by the researcher) and the biological validation and application (led by the collaborator). The project should be positioned as creating a community-wide resource that aligns with PGRP's goal of empowering a broad base of researchers.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a credible, transdisciplinary team with a Co-PI from the plant sciences who can ground the project in a significant biological question.
- Clearly articulating how the proposed AI/IoT tools will overcome a specific, well-recognized bottleneck in plant functional genomics (e.g., phenotyping throughput, data interpretation).
- Leveraging the 'academic entrepreneur' and SBIR background to frame the project's outcomes as robust, usable, and accessible community resources with clear societal impact.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The primary challenge is the researcher's lack of a publication record or prior funding in biology or genomics, which creates a credibility gap that must be filled by a strong collaborator.
- The proposal must convincingly demonstrate that the advanced AI/ML methods are not just technically novel but are thoughtfully adapted to the unique complexities and 'noise' of biological data, moving beyond a simple application of an existing algorithm.

### 85. Smart Health and Biomedical Research in the Era of Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Data Science (SCH) (Score: 72)

**Program ID:** 504739  
**Compatibility Score:** 72/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is a strong potential match due to Dr. Reyes's deep expertise in AI, IoT, and Edge computing, but a successful proposal is contingent on securing a strong biomedical collaborator to address a specific, pressing health question.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Reyes's technical expertise is exceptionally well-aligned with the core needs of the SCH program. The solicitation calls for novel methods to 'collect, sense, connect, analyze and interpret data from individuals, devices and systems.' His skills in IoT, Wearable Technology, and Low-power electronics directly address the 'collect and sense' aspects. His deep knowledge of Anomaly/Outlier Detection, Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI), and Explainable AI (XAI) provides a powerful toolkit for the 'analyze and interpret' phase. Specifically, Edge AI on wearables can enable real-time, privacy-preserving health monitoring, while XAI is crucial for gaining clinical trust and utility.
- **Research Domain Match:** There is a partial but critical mismatch. Dr. Reyes's domains (Computer Science, Engineering, Machine Learning) are explicitly requested by the solicitation. However, the SCH program mandates that these skills be applied to 'health_biomedical' or 'social_behavioral' problems. Dr. Reyes's profile and proposal history suggest a primary focus on manufacturing, energy, and digital IP, with no stated experience or collaborators in the biomedical field. This is the most significant gap that must be addressed for a competitive proposal.
- **Experience Relevance:** Dr. Reyes's experience as a mid-career academic entrepreneur with $1.2M in secured funding is a major asset. His success with NSF SBIR programs demonstrates an ability to frame research for tangible impact, which aligns with the 'transformative' and 'high-reward' goals of the SCH program. However, the unsuccessful NIH proposals (`NIH SBIR Phase 1 proposal (AD).pdf`, `NIH LLMs.pdf`) are cautionary. They suggest a potential difficulty in translating his technical expertise into the language and problem-space of health research. He must shift his narrative from a technology-push/commercialization focus (common in SBIR/PFI) to a problem-pull/fundamental science discovery focus required by this solicitation.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. A project combining Edge AI, anomaly detection, and XAI for a specific health application would be highly innovative. For example, a proposal could focus on developing a novel, energy-efficient Edge AI framework for wearable sensors to provide real-time, explainable alerts for the early onset of a chronic disease exacerbation (e.g., COPD, heart failure). The innovation would lie not just in applying AI to health, but in advancing the fundamental computer science and engineering of AI itself to meet the unique constraints (power, privacy, interpretability) of the biomedical domain.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Reframe the 'remote asset' from an industrial machine to a human patient. The core technology of 'outlier detection for remote monitoring' is directly transferable. The proposal must be adapted by partnering with a clinical researcher to define a high-impact medical condition where continuous monitoring and anomaly detection are critical (e.g., post-operative recovery, chronic disease management, elderly fall detection). The focus must shift from preventing machine failure to predicting adverse health events.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections describing the outlier detection algorithms, the architecture for data streaming and remote monitoring, and the discussion on system constraints can be largely reused as a starting point.
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Leverage the 'AutoML on-device AI' concept for personalized medicine. The proposal could describe a system that uses AutoML to create a unique, personalized health model for each individual user on their own device (e.g., smartphone or wearable). This addresses the significant challenge of patient heterogeneity in medicine. The adaptation requires identifying a health scenario where personalization is key, such as adjusting medication timing based on real-time physiological data or tailoring digital therapeutic interventions.
  - Reusable Elements: The core technical description of the AutoML framework, its implementation on low-power devices (OnDeviceAI/Edge AI), and the arguments for its efficiency and efficacy can be adapted for the new biomedical context.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy must be 'collaboration-first.' Dr. Reyes should not write a technology proposal and search for a health application. Instead, he must first identify and build a genuine partnership with a biomedical or public health researcher who has a compelling, well-defined problem and access to relevant data or patient populations. The proposal should be co-developed, with the narrative driven by the health challenge. His technical contributions should be positioned as the unique, enabling innovation that makes a solution to this previously intractable health problem possible. He should emphasize the fundamental advancements in computer science (e.g., new XAI methods for clinical data, novel low-power ML algorithms) that will emerge from this research.

#### Success Factors
- His cutting-edge technical expertise in Edge AI, XAI, and anomaly detection is a perfect fit for the 'Smart Health' theme and directly addresses the program's technical goals.
- The entrepreneurial background and success with impact-oriented grants (SBIR/PFI) provide a strong basis for arguing the 'transformative' and 'high-reward' potential of the proposed research.
- The interdisciplinary nature of the call is an opportunity. A strong partnership can merge his proven engineering innovation with a critical health need, creating a highly competitive '1+1=3' proposal.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The lack of demonstrated biomedical research experience or established collaborations is the most critical weakness. A proposal without a credible, deeply integrated biomedical/clinical partner is highly unlikely to be funded by this program.
- A history of successful SBIR/PFI grants may lead to a proposal framing that is too focused on application/commercialization. He must pivot to emphasize the generation of new, fundamental knowledge in computer science and engineering, driven by the health problem.

### 86. Growing Research Access for Nationally Transformative Economic Development (GRANTED) (Score: 72)

**Program ID:** 506178  
**Compatibility Score:** 72/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong but unconventional match, requiring the researcher to pivot his expertise from developing technology to architecting scalable infrastructure and programs that help other researchers commercialize their own deep-tech innovations.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** There is no direct technical alignment, and this is by design, as GRANTED does not fund discipline-specific R&D. However, the researcher's deep expertise in high-demand fields like AI, LLMs, and IoT provides him with critical, firsthand knowledge of the specific infrastructure bottlenecks, administrative hurdles, and support gaps that researchers in these areas face. His technical background serves as the evidence base for identifying a critical problem in the research enterprise that a GRANTED project could solve, lending immense credibility to the proposed solution.
- **Research Domain Match:** The primary domain match is not Computer Science or Engineering, but rather the researcher's demonstrated expertise in 'Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization' and 'Digital IP Protection'. These areas align perfectly with GRANTED's explicit focus on strengthening 'technology transfer and commercialization,' 'corporate relations/public-private partnerships,' and the overall administrative infrastructure that supports the translation of research into economic impact.
- **Experience Relevance:** Extremely high relevance. As a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with over $1.2M in funding and 7 successful proposals, including what appears to be multiple NSF SBIR awards, the researcher has direct, lived experience in navigating the entire research-to-market pipeline. This background is precisely what GRANTED seeks in proposers who aim to build more robust and equitable systems for tech transfer and commercialization. His success provides a powerful narrative and a proven model that can be scaled or adapted to benefit other institutions.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for an innovative proposal is high. Leveraging his unique perspective, the researcher could propose novel, high-impact projects such as: 1) A scalable, AI-powered platform using LLMs to assist under-resourced institutions in drafting competitive commercialization plans for federal grants. 2) A multi-institutional consortium that creates a 'Tech Transfer as a Service' hub for emerging research institutions, focused specifically on deep-tech IP. 3) A national training curriculum, co-led by research administrators and academic entrepreneurs, to embed commercialization and IP strategy into STEM graduate programs, thereby developing human capital in this crucial area.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Deconstruct the process and challenges of creating this successful SBIR proposal and its commercialization plan. Frame a GRANTED proposal around creating a 'playbook' and workshop series to demystify the SBIR/STTR process for faculty at institutions with less commercialization support (e.g., PUIs, MSIs). The original proposal serves as a case study for the problem you are now trying to solve at a systemic level.
  - Reusable Elements: The 'Commercialization Plan' and 'Broader Impacts' sections can be repurposed not as a plan for one product, but as a template and teaching tool. The market analysis can be reused to demonstrate the economic potential that is currently untapped at under-resourced institutions.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: PFI proposals require robust academic-industry partnership plans. Adapt the partnership and collaboration framework from this proposal to create a replicable model. The GRANTED project would not be about a specific technology, but about creating and disseminating a best-practice framework for how universities can establish and manage deep-tech partnerships, with a focus on helping institutions that lack dedicated corporate relations offices.
  - Reusable Elements: The Partnership Management Plan, IP management strategy, and the structure of Letters of Collaboration can be generalized into a toolkit. The core logic connecting research activities to specific societal and economic needs is directly transferable to the GRANTED proposal's justification.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy is to frame the proposal as a 'meta' project. The researcher must position himself not as a technologist seeking funding for R&D, but as a successful academic entrepreneur who now wants to architect the systems to help others succeed. The narrative should be: 'My journey through the tech commercialization valley of death revealed systemic barriers. This project will build the infrastructure—the tools, training, and networks—to create a superhighway for a broader and more diverse group of researchers to translate their work into national economic impact.' Partnering with a senior research administrator as a Co-PI is non-negotiable for this program.

#### Success Factors
- **Form a Leadership Coalition:** The proposal MUST feature professional research support staff (e.g., a Director of a Sponsored Programs Office, a Tech Transfer Officer, or a VP for Research) in a PI or Co-PI leadership role, as explicitly required by GRANTED.
- **Systemic Focus over Technical Focus:** The project's primary activities and deliverables must be focused on creating, improving, and scaling administrative processes, training programs, or shared support infrastructure, not on developing a new piece of technology.
- **Demonstrate Broadening Participation:** The proposal must include genuine partnerships with and a clear plan to benefit under-resourced and/or emerging research institutions (e.g., EPSCoR jurisdictions, MSIs, PUIs) to address the equity goals of the GRANTED program.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **Mindset Pivot:** The primary challenge will be to shift from the familiar mindset of a PI developing a technical solution to that of a systems architect designing enabling infrastructure for others. The proposal must rigorously avoid any language that makes it sound like a disguised R&D project.
- **Building a New Network:** The researcher will need to invest significant effort in building a coalition outside of his typical technical circles, establishing strong, collaborative relationships with senior research administrators and leaders at different types of institutions.

The opportunity calls for AI, robotics, sensing, and communications. His skills in 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)', 'IoT', 'Low-power electronics', 'Computer Vision', and 'Smart Agriculture Technologies' directly address the AI and sensing components. His work in 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' is perfect for applications like pest/disease identification or equipment malfunction prediction. 'Explainable AI (XAI)' can address farmer adoption and trust, a key aspect of real-world impact. While direct robotics experience isn't listed, his IoT and Edge AI work provides the foundational sensing and control-loop intelligence for agricultural robotic systems, which can be a key contribution to a team with robotics hardware experts.
- **Research Domain Match:** The match in research domain is excellent. The researcher's listed domain of 'Smart Agriculture Technologies' is a direct hit with the program's focus on 'direct applications to agriculture'. His broader domains of Computer Science and Engineering provide the fundamental knowledge base. Furthermore, his expertise in 'Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization' strongly resonates with the program's goal to 'transform agricultural approaches and generate global impact,' suggesting he can frame the research in terms of tangible, scalable outcomes.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's track record of securing over $1.2M in funding, including multiple NSF SBIR awards, demonstrates a proven ability to write successful, high-impact proposals for the NSF. The topics of his successful proposals, such as 'AutoML_OnDeviceAI', are highly relevant and can be directly adapted. His mid-career status and entrepreneurial background position him as a credible leader for the US-based portion of a multi-national team, capable of bridging fundamental research with practical application.
- **Innovation Potential:** Dr. Costilla Reyes has the potential to make several innovative contributions. The most significant lies in combining 'Edge AI' with 'Low-power electronics' and 'Energy Harvesting Systems' to create self-sustaining, intelligent sensor networks for in-field agricultural monitoring. This directly addresses the challenges of power and connectivity in rural farm settings. A second novel angle is applying his 'Watermarking techniques' to secure the provenance and ownership of farm data, a critical issue for data sovereignty and farmer trust. Finally, integrating 'XAI' into agricultural decision-support tools could significantly improve adoption by making AI recommendations transparent and understandable to farmers.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot from a commercialization-focused SBIR framework to a fundamental, collaborative research project. The core idea should shift from creating a product to answering a scientific question, such as: 'How can a federated, on-device AutoML framework be developed to adapt to diverse agro-climatic zones across the Quad nations without sharing sensitive raw data?' This reframing aligns with the international, multi-environment nature of the call.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical architecture for on-device AI, the algorithms for AutoML, the discussion of computational constraints and efficiency, and the justification for why Edge AI is superior to cloud-based approaches for this application.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Re-contextualize this unsuccessful PFI proposal from general 'remote asset monitoring' to a specific, high-impact agricultural application. For example, focus on using outlier detection to monitor the health and operational status of critical irrigation systems or to detect early-stage crop stress from remote sensing data (drones, satellites). The proposal should emphasize the collaborative aspect: how data from different Quad regions can be used to build more robust and generalizable anomaly detection models.
  - Reusable Elements: The core machine learning methodology for outlier detection, the proposed system architecture for data ingestion and analysis, and the arguments for the economic and operational impact of proactive monitoring.

**Strategic Positioning:** The most competitive strategy is to frame a proposal around 'Trustworthy and Autonomous AI for Resilient Agriculture'. This theme leverages the researcher's unique combination of skills. The strategy should be: 
1. **Immediately Network for Partners:** Proactively identify and contact researchers at CSIRO (Australia), ICAR (India), and JST-funded institutions (Japan) whose work complements his expertise (e.g., experts in agronomy, robotics, or plant sciences).
2. **Propose a Federated Learning Framework:** Pitch a project that uses Edge AI and federated learning to build robust models across international datasets without compromising data privacy—a key selling point for international collaboration.
3. **Emphasize the 'Trust' Angle:** Highlight the integration of XAI to increase farmer adoption and watermarking to ensure data security, positioning the project as a holistic, human-centric solution.
4. **Define Clear Roles:** The proposal must clearly articulate the unique and essential contribution of each international partner, justifying why the collaboration is necessary to achieve the research goals.

#### Success Factors
- Forging a strong, multi-national team with clearly defined, synergistic roles is the absolute most critical factor for success.
- Leveraging the unique technical niche of combining resource-efficient Edge AI with XAI and data watermarking to create a novel, trustworthy system for a specific agricultural challenge.
- Clearly articulating how research across the diverse agricultural contexts of the Quad nations will lead to robust, globally scalable solutions for food security.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- **The Collaboration Gap:** The researcher's profile does not indicate existing collaborations with researchers in Australia, India, or Japan. Building a genuine, integrated research team from scratch that meets the 'at least three countries' requirement is a significant logistical and networking challenge.
- **Shifting from Commercial to Collaborative Framing:** The researcher's recent funding success is in the NSF SBIR program, which is focused on commercialization. This AI-ENGAGE opportunity, submitted through NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), requires a focus on fundamental research questions and the value of international collaboration itself, which demands a different proposal narrative and structure.

### 88. NSF Trailblazer Engineering Impact Award (Score: 70)

**Program ID:** 506207  
**Compatibility Score:** 70/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is a strong potential match for the researcher's established, innovative engineering profile, but success is entirely contingent on developing a compelling proposal for a research area that is genuinely new and distinct from his current, extensive expertise in AI/ML.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's deep technical expertise in AI, Machine Learning at the Edge, IoT, and computer vision aligns perfectly with the opportunity's broad 'artificial_intelligence' and 'engineering_technology' research areas. His skills represent the cutting edge of engineering, which is what the TRAILBLAZER program seeks to leverage. He possesses the foundational knowledge to credibly propose a high-impact engineering project.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science and Engineering are central to this NSF Directorate for Engineering opportunity. The program's emphasis on catalyzing the 'convergence of engineering and science' is a key area where he can excel. By connecting his engineering and computational expertise to a fundamental science domain (e.g., materials science, neuroscience, synthetic biology), he can create a powerful convergence narrative.
- **Experience Relevance:** His status as a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with over $1.2M in funding demonstrates a 'distinctive track record of innovation and creativity' as required. This history of securing competitive funding is a major asset. However, the apparent focus on SBIR grants (commercialization-oriented) represents a narrative risk. He must reframe his experience to highlight fundamental innovation and creative problem-solving rather than commercial outcomes to align with the TRAILBLAZER program's ethos.
- **Innovation Potential:** The researcher's potential for innovation is extremely high. The key is to channel this potential into a new domain. Instead of proposing a more advanced anomaly detection system for manufacturing (an extension of his work), he could propose using the *principles* of anomaly detection and Edge AI to create a novel system for predicting seismic events or detecting emergent pathogens in wastewater. The innovation lies in the bold application of his proven creative process to an entirely new problem space.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: CRITICAL: Do NOT adapt the research topic. This proposal's content is unsuitable as it represents prior work. Instead, analyze its structure as a successful NSF proposal. Adapt the narrative style used to explain complex technology, the structure of the project plan, and the framing of the broader impacts. Use this as a template for *how* to write a compelling proposal for a *completely new* research idea.
  - Reusable Elements: Structural elements only: Budget justification format (as a reference), biographical sketch style, description of resources and facilities, and potentially the high-level narrative structure for framing a problem and a proposed solution. The scientific content must be discarded for the TRAILBLAZER application.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy must be the 'Compelling Pivot.' The proposal narrative should be built around a story: 'My successful career in X (e.g., AI for manufacturing) has given me a unique perspective and toolset. I have now identified a grand challenge in a completely different field, Y (e.g., personalized medicine, atmospheric science), where progress is stalled. I propose to apply my trailblazing approach, leveraging foundational principles from my past work, to create a paradigm shift in field Y.' This strategy directly addresses the program's core requirement for a new research direction while capitalizing on his proven track record. The project must be framed as fundamental, high-risk research, explicitly avoiding the commercialization language of an SBIR grant.

#### Success Factors
- Developing a genuinely novel, high-risk/high-reward research idea that is demonstrably distinct from his entire portfolio of AI/ML, IoT, and manufacturing work.
- Constructing a powerful 'pivot narrative' that justifies why he is the right person to tackle this new challenge and how his past successes have prepared him for this new direction.
- Verifying and meeting the strict PI eligibility requirements: holding a tenured/tenure-eligible faculty appointment at the Associate or Full Professor rank (or equivalent) and having an appointment in an Engineering School/College OR an Engineering Doctorate.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The Pivot Hurdle: The program's single most important requirement is a departure from current research. Overcoming reviewer skepticism that the new topic is just a repackaging of old ideas will be the primary challenge.
- Reframing from Entrepreneur to Foundational Researcher: His profile as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' and history of SBIR grants could be perceived as a mismatch for a program focused on fundamental research. The proposal must meticulously avoid commercial framing and focus on scientific discovery and national impact.
- Eligibility Verification: The provided profile does not explicitly confirm his academic rank or appointment type, which are non-negotiable, 'Return without Review' criteria for this specific program.

### 89. U.S. National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Program (Score: 70)

**Program ID:** 505015  
**Compatibility Score:** 70/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match if the researcher can pivot from his technology commercialization focus (SBIR/PFI) to lead a large-scale, institution-wide graduate training program, leveraging his entrepreneurial expertise as the core innovation of the traineeship model.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Excellent. Dr. Costilla Reyes's expertise in AI/ML, IoT, Edge AI, XAI, and watermarking techniques directly aligns with the NRT's target research areas of 'artificial_intelligence' and 'engineering_technology'. These fields are high-priority areas of national interest, providing a strong foundation for a compelling NRT research theme. His specific work in manufacturing QA, clean energy, and smart agriculture can be woven into a convergent research narrative focused on major societal challenges.
- **Research Domain Match:** High. The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are central to the NRT program's STEM focus. He is well-positioned to propose a timely and impactful interdisciplinary theme, such as 'Convergent AI and IoT for Sustainable and Secure Critical Infrastructure' or 'Trustworthy and Explainable AI in Manufacturing and Digital Economies', which would integrate his core expertise.
- **Experience Relevance:** Mixed but promising. His success with NSF SBIR grants is a significant asset, demonstrating experience with NSF, successful project management, and a deep understanding of technology commercialization. This directly supports the NRT's goal of preparing students for a range of STEM careers, especially in the private sector. However, his profile lacks explicit evidence of leading large-scale graduate education or training programs. The NRT is primarily an education/training grant, not a research or commercialization grant, which represents a significant strategic shift from his previous successful proposals.
- **Innovation Potential:** Very High. Dr. Costilla Reyes's unique profile as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' is a major strength. He can propose a highly innovative training model that is not purely academic. The innovation would be a curriculum deeply integrated with entrepreneurial training, technology transfer, IP protection (leveraging his watermarking expertise), and direct collaboration with industry. This model, which trains PhDs to be innovators and tech leaders, directly addresses the NRT's call for 'innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs'.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF23_ExLENT_AutoVideo.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The NSF ExLENT program focuses on experiential learning, which is a core component of the NRT. Adapt the 'experiential learning' framework from this proposal and scale it up significantly. The original proposal likely focused on a specific project or course; this needs to be expanded into a comprehensive, multi-year graduate training program with cohorts of students, a full curriculum of professional development activities, and deep industry/partner integration.
  - Reusable Elements: The core concepts of experiential learning activities, potential industry partner connections, and the framing of skill development for non-academic careers can be reused and expanded. The description of the 'emerging and novel technologies' is a good starting point for the NRT research theme.
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The NSF PFI program requires strong industry collaboration and a focus on societal impact. Leverage the partnership-building and 'broader impacts' sections from this proposal as a foundation for the NRT's required collaborations. The NRT requires a much deeper and more structured integration of partners into the training itself (e.g., co-mentorship, internships, curriculum design), so the PFI plan would need to be substantially deepened.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement, articulation of societal need, and list of potential industry partners or letters of collaboration. The plan for technology transfer or market transition can be repurposed as a training module for the graduate students.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy must be to frame the entire proposal around a 'Traineeship for the STEM Innovator'. The PI should not position himself as just a technical expert, but as the leader of a new paradigm in graduate education. Key steps include: 1) Building a leadership team with co-PIs from the Graduate School and/or College of Education to cover pedagogical and student development expertise. 2) Centering the proposal on the unique training elements—entrepreneurship bootcamps, industry-led technical modules, mandatory internships, and training in IP management and venture creation. 3) Formalizing deep partnerships with industry, national labs, and NGOs, with clear roles for them in training, mentoring, and placing students. 4) Developing a robust and evidence-based plan for recruiting and retaining a diverse cohort of trainees, collaborating with existing institutional programs like LSAMP or AGEP.

#### Success Factors
- Clearly articulating a novel, entrepreneurship-focused training model that goes beyond traditional academic development and directly addresses the NRT's goal of preparing students for diverse STEM careers.
- Forging a strong, interdisciplinary PI team that combines the researcher's technical and commercialization expertise with demonstrated experience in graduate curriculum design, mentorship, and broadening participation.
- Securing meaningful letters of collaboration from a diverse set of partners (private sector, national labs, etc.) that detail specific commitments to the training program, such as funding for internships, co-mentorship of students, or providing training modules.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Demonstrating credibility and experience in managing a large-scale, multi-year, multi-million dollar graduate training program. The proposal must proactively address this potential weakness by including co-PIs and senior personnel with strong track records in this area.
- Shifting the proposal's narrative focus from the research outcomes (the focus of a standard grant) or commercialization (the focus of an SBIR) to the development and success of the student trainees. Every element must be justified in terms of how it benefits the trainees' development.
- Developing a comprehensive and convincing recruitment and retention plan for broadening participation. This is a critical review criterion for NRT and requires more than a generic statement; it needs specific, actionable, and measurable strategies.

### 90. IUCRC Proposals for Research and Thought Leadership on Insurance Risk Modeling and Underwriting Related to Terrorism and Catastrophic Cyber Risks: A Joint NSF and U.S. Department of the Treasury Federal Insurance Office Call (Score: 70)

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 70/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match due to the researcher's deep expertise in AI/ML for anomaly detection and digital asset protection, which directly addresses the catastrophic cyber risk component, but success is contingent on building a multi-disciplinary team to cover the critical insurance, finance, and policy domains.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise shows excellent alignment with the 'catastrophic cyber risk' portion of this opportunity. His skills in Anomaly/Outlier Detection are directly applicable to identifying precursors of large-scale, coordinated cyber-attacks. Experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to analyze vast amounts of unstructured threat intelligence, model systemic risk propagation through textual analysis of dependency documents, or even generate synthetic scenarios for events that lack historical data. Watermarking and Digital IP Protection expertise provides a unique angle for modeling the value-at-risk for digital assets, a core challenge in cyber insurance underwriting. Furthermore, his work in Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for this domain, as any proposed risk models must be interpretable to underwriters, regulators (like the Treasury FIO), and capital markets.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's primary domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are an excellent match for the technical thrust of the proposed IUCRC, strongly aligning with the interests of NSF's CISE and TIP directorates. However, the opportunity is a joint call with the Treasury FIO and involves the SBE directorate, explicitly requiring expertise in risk management, insurance, finance, economics, and public policy. The researcher's current profile shows a gap in these SBE-related domains. While his entrepreneurial focus provides a bridge to the business world, a successful proposal will require formal collaboration with experts from these other fields.
- **Experience Relevance:** As a 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' with over $1.2M in funding and multiple successful NSF proposals (including commercialization-focused SBIRs), the researcher has demonstrated the exact mindset required to lead an IUCRC. IUCRCs thrive on industry collaboration, use-inspired research, and a path to self-sufficiency—all concepts familiar to a PI with SBIR and tech commercialization experience. This entrepreneurial track record is a significant advantage over purely academic PIs. The challenge will be scaling from leading project-based grants to managing the complex, multi-stakeholder ecosystem of a large research center.
- **Innovation Potential:** The researcher is well-positioned to drive significant innovation. He could propose a novel framework that combines Edge AI on IoT devices with centralized anomaly detection to create a real-time model of correlated risk in cyber-physical systems (e.g., power grids, logistics networks). Another innovative direction would be using Generative AI and LLMs to create high-fidelity synthetic datasets of plausible but unseen catastrophic cyber events, directly addressing the core 'lack of historical data' problem cited in the DCL. This could revolutionize how insurers approach reserving and capital allocation for these risks.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Reframe the core technology from 'remote asset monitoring' to 'modeling systemic risk in critical infrastructure.' The fundamental outlier detection algorithms can be adapted from monitoring individual physical assets to detecting correlated anomalies across vast, interconnected digital and physical systems, which is the essence of a catastrophic cyber event. The narrative should shift from preventing single-asset failure to providing insurers with tools to underwrite portfolio-level systemic risk.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections on outlier detection algorithms, data processing pipelines, and system architecture. The justification for industry need can be broadened from a specific vertical to the entire insurance and critical infrastructure sector.
- **NSF23_SBIR_ph2_ProjectDescription.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: While the SBIR structure is for a small business, the *spirit* of this proposal is highly adaptable. The sections on market analysis, commercialization plan, and letters of support from industry are precursors to the 'industry discovery' and member recruitment required for an IUCRC. Adapt the 'problem/opportunity' section to focus on the national-level economic and security challenge outlined in the DCL, and expand the 'commercialization' plan into a 'sustainability and member value' plan for the center.
  - Reusable Elements: The narrative style that connects deep technology to clear business/market value. Frameworks for describing return on investment for partners. Any existing language around industry engagement and stakeholder benefits.

**Strategic Positioning:** The winning strategy is to position himself as the technical lead of a broader, interdisciplinary team. He should not propose to lead this effort alone. The immediate next step is to identify and partner with senior, credible co-PIs from his or other institutions who bring the missing domain expertise: a professor of finance or insurance from a business school and an expert in technology policy or national security from a public policy school. The proposal narrative must be framed as a solution to a national economic security challenge, not just a technical one. He should leverage his entrepreneurial skills to immediately begin the 'industry discovery' process, engaging with major insurers, reinsurers, and cyber risk modeling firms to co-develop the center's research vision and secure strong letters of interest, which are critical for the IUCRC planning grant stage.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a credible, high-profile interdisciplinary leadership team that seamlessly blends top-tier computer science with deep expertise in insurance, finance, and public policy.
- Demonstrating significant industry buy-in before the proposal is submitted, with concrete letters of interest from future dues-paying members of the proposed center's Industry Advisory Board.
- Articulating a compelling research vision that directly tackles the fundamental challenges of data scarcity and systemic risk modeling for terrorism and cyber events, offering a clear value proposition to both industry and government stakeholders.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- A significant gap in demonstrated expertise in the non-technical domains central to the call: insurance/reinsurance, financial risk modeling, economics, and terrorism risk analysis. This must be filled via team formation.
- Transitioning from the leadership style of project-based grants (like SBIRs or PFI) to the consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder management required to establish and run a large-scale, multi-university, industry-funded research center.

### 91. International Multilateral Partnerships for Resilient Education and Science System in Ukraine (IMPRESS-U) (Score: 70)

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 70/100  
**Summary:** An excellent technical match due to strong expertise in AI, LLMs, and Edge AI, but a successful proposal hinges on strategically framing this expertise to address the DCL's core goals of educational resilience and establishing a strong partnership with Ukrainian collaborators.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise is highly aligned with the opportunity's 'artificial_intelligence' and 'education' research areas. His skills in Large Language Models (LLMs), Explainable AI (XAI), and especially Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI) are directly applicable. For instance, he could propose developing decentralized, robust educational platforms using Edge AI that function with intermittent connectivity—a critical need for a 'resilient' system. LLMs could be used for personalized learning tools, and his work in watermarking could be adapted to protect Ukrainian educational and scientific intellectual property.
- **Research Domain Match:** There is a strong match in the 'AI' component, but a gap in the 'Education' component. The researcher's domains are Computer Science and Engineering, not education science. To be successful, the proposal must not just be an AI project but must be fundamentally motivated by and designed to solve a specific challenge within the Ukrainian education system. The project must integrate his technical expertise into an educational context, which will require close collaboration with education experts, preferably from the Ukrainian partner institution.
- **Experience Relevance:** The researcher's experience is a mix of strengths and potential weaknesses. His $1.2M+ in funding and 7 successful proposals demonstrate a strong ability to secure competitive funding. His extensive experience with NSF SBIR grants shows he can develop robust, real-world applications, which aligns well with the 'resilience' theme. However, his profile lacks explicit experience in international collaborations or projects focused purely on academic capacity-building, which are central to the IMPRESS-U DCL. Reviewers will look for evidence that he can navigate the complexities of a multilateral partnership.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The researcher can combine his expertise in Edge AI, IoT, and LLMs to create novel solutions tailored for Ukraine's needs. An innovative proposal could focus on creating an 'Education Resilience Toolkit' featuring offline-capable learning modules, AI-powered assessment tools that don't rely on central servers, and secure communication platforms for students and faculty. His entrepreneurial background can be positioned as a strength in building sustainable, impactful systems rather than purely theoretical models.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF21_SBIR_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Pivot the project's primary goal from commercialization (SBIR focus) to capacity-building and open-source implementation (IMPRESS-U focus). The core technology of AutoML for on-device AI is perfectly suited for creating resilient systems. The proposal should be rewritten to position a Ukrainian university or research institute as the primary beneficiary and co-developer, not a commercial customer. The project's success metrics should be defined by student/researcher adoption, system robustness in low-resource environments, and the creation of a sustainable, open-source platform for Ukrainian education.
  - Reusable Elements: The entire technical section describing AutoML, the benefits of on-device/edge AI (privacy, low latency, offline capability), and the core algorithms can be reused almost verbatim. The background and motivation can be adapted to focus on the challenges facing the Ukrainian education system instead of a commercial market need.

**Strategic Positioning:** The most critical first step is to identify and establish a genuine partnership with a Ukrainian research institution. The proposal must be co-authored and co-developed, addressing a need explicitly identified by the Ukrainian partner. He should frame his 'Academic Entrepreneur' profile as a unique ability to translate cutting-edge research into practical, sustainable, and resilient systems. Since he may not have a current NSF award to supplement, the strategy should be to submit a new proposal to a relevant NSF core program (e.g., within the CISE directorate), clearly flagging it for consideration under the IMPRESS-U DCL. The proposal narrative must emphasize knowledge transfer, training for Ukrainian students and faculty, and long-term sustainability.

#### Success Factors
- Establishing an authentic, co-creative partnership with a Ukrainian institution before writing the proposal, ensuring their needs drive the project.
- Explicitly and repeatedly linking the proposed technology (e.g., Edge AI) to the core theme of 'resilience' in the context of Ukraine's education and science systems.
- Successfully translating his SBIR-honed skills in building robust products into a compelling narrative about creating sustainable, open-source, capacity-building solutions for a non-commercial, academic goal.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Demonstrating capability for managing a complex international collaboration without prior documented experience in this area.
- Shifting the proposal narrative and project design away from the commercialization-centric model of his successful SBIR grants to the academic, collaborative, and capacity-building focus required by this DCL.

**Program ID:** 5444  
**Compatibility Score:** 70/100  
**Summary:** This opportunity is a strong potential match for the 'Cyberinfrastructure' track by leveraging the researcher's deep AI/ML expertise, but success is entirely contingent on forming a strategic collaboration with biologists to ground the project in a specific, high-impact biological research community need.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Excellent. Dr. Costilla Reyes's expertise in Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI), Computer Vision, and Explainable AI (XAI) aligns perfectly with the 'Cyberinfrastructure' programmatic area. This expertise can be directly applied to build innovative tools for biological research, such as: 1) Edge AI systems for real-time data processing at remote Biological Field Stations (e.g., automated species identification from camera traps or acoustic sensors). 2) A large-scale Computer Vision platform for analyzing massive biological imaging datasets (e.g., microscopy, satellite imagery). 3) An LLM-based system to mine, synthesize, and query vast amounts of unstructured biological literature and field notes. 4) An XAI framework to make complex biological models more interpretable for researchers who are not ML experts.
- **Research Domain Match:** Moderate but with a clear path forward. The researcher's primary domains are Computer Science and Engineering, not Biology, which is a significant gap for a proposal to the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). However, his experience in 'Smart Agriculture Technologies' demonstrates a successful application of his core skills to a biology-adjacent field. To be competitive, he must frame his work not as CS research, but as the creation of a vital tool that solves a pressing, well-defined problem for a broad community of biologists. This necessitates deep collaboration with PIs from the biological sciences.
- **Experience Relevance:** Strong. A track record of securing over $1.2M from 7 proposals, including NSF SBIR grants, demonstrates credibility and an understanding of the NSF ecosystem. His status as an 'Academic Entrepreneur' is highly relevant to the program's goal of building scalable and sustainable 'products and services'. Furthermore, his experience with unsuccessful proposals for programs like POSE (Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems) is valuable, as the lessons learned in framing community-driven, open-source projects are directly applicable to the 'Capacity' program's requirements for open access and community service.
- **Innovation Potential:** High. The application of state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques to biological infrastructure offers immense innovation potential. A proposal could pioneer federated learning for ecological data across a network of field stations, preserving data privacy while building more robust models. Another innovative angle would be to create a 'Cyberinfrastructure-as-a-Service' platform that leverages his AutoML expertise, allowing biologists with no coding experience to upload their data and train/deploy custom AI models for their specific research questions. This would directly address the program's goal of enabling 'important science outcomes that will be achieved by the users of the resource'.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_POSE_TODS.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful POSE proposal is philosophically the closest match. The core idea of an open-source system should be reframed from a generic tool to one solving a specific biological challenge. For instance, adapt the 'Outlier Detection System' to identify anomalous events in ecological sensor networks or to flag rare but significant sequences in genomic data. The key is to partner with a biological research community (e.g., a Research Coordination Network or a group of field stations) to define the use case and co-develop the proposal, with biologists as co-PIs.
  - Reusable Elements: The sections on open-source governance, community building, user engagement plans, and software architecture can be largely reused. The vision for creating a sustainable, community-driven resource is directly transferable.
- **NSF22_SBIR_ph2_AutoML_OnDeviceAI.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The technology from this SBIR proposal is highly relevant, but the commercial framing must be completely replaced with a community-infrastructure focus. Propose creating an open, customizable platform for 'AutoML at the Edge' specifically for Biological Field Stations and Marine Labs. The project would deploy hardware and provide software/training to a consortium of partner stations, enabling them to conduct real-time, on-site data analysis.
  - Reusable Elements: The detailed technical description of the AutoML pipeline, the on-device AI architecture, system performance benchmarks, and power consumption analysis are all directly reusable to establish technical feasibility.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy must be 'Cyberinfrastructure in Service of Biology'. The researcher should not position himself as the lead scientist, but as the lead architect building a foundational platform for others. The proposal must be co-led with PIs from the biological sciences who represent the target user community. The narrative should focus on the new biological questions that can be answered by the community using this infrastructure, rather than the technical novelty of the AI alone. Leveraging the 'Smart Agriculture' experience as a prior example of successful cross-domain application will strengthen the argument for his capability to bridge this gap.

#### Success Factors
- Forming a genuine, integrated collaboration with a well-defined biological research community, with key members from that community serving as co-PIs on the proposal.
- Clearly articulating a compelling biological grand challenge that cannot be addressed with existing infrastructure and demonstrating how the proposed platform will directly enable that research for a broad user base.
- Providing a detailed, credible plan for outreach, user training, community governance, and long-term sustainability to ensure the resource thrives beyond the grant period.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Credibility gap in the biological sciences: As a computer scientist, Dr. Costilla Reyes will be scrutinized by reviewers from the BIO directorate. Without strong biologist co-PIs and compelling letters of collaboration from the target community, the proposal is unlikely to be viewed as credible.
- Shifting from a commercialization (SBIR) to a community-service (Capacity) mindset: The metrics for success must be redefined away from intellectual property and revenue towards user adoption, community contributions, and scientific discoveries enabled by the platform.

### 93. Advancing Educational Innovations and Broadening Participation in STEM with Blockchain Technology (Score: 70)

**Program ID:**   
**Compatibility Score:** 70/100  
**Summary:** This is a promising but challenging match, leveraging the researcher's strong expertise in digital IP protection which aligns with blockchain's core function, but requiring a strategic pivot to apply these skills to educational innovation and broadening participation.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** Dr. Costilla Reyes's deep expertise in 'Watermarking techniques for digital asset protection' and 'Digital IP Protection' is highly synergistic with the core principles of blockchain technology. Blockchain is essentially a distributed, immutable ledger for tracking and verifying digital assets. His skills can be directly applied to creating systems for verifiable educational credentials (micro-degrees, badges), protecting student-created intellectual property, or ensuring the provenance of educational materials. His work in 'LLMs' and 'XAI' could be integrated to build intelligent tutoring or assessment systems where the results and progress are securely logged on a blockchain.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's primary domains of Computer Science and Engineering strongly align with the 'artificial_intelligence' and 'engineering_technology' research areas of the opportunity. However, there is a significant gap in the 'education' domain. While he has the technical tools, the profile lacks demonstrated experience in pedagogical theory, learning sciences, or curriculum development. This is the most critical domain gap to address.
- **Experience Relevance:** His track record of securing $1.27M in funding, particularly through multiple NSF SBIR awards, demonstrates a proven ability to frame research for practical, innovative impact. This 'Academic Entrepreneur' profile is a major strength, suggesting he can develop a tangible technology. However, the emphasis of this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) on 'Broadening Participation' may require a different framing than his previous commercialization-focused SBIR proposals. His unsuccessful proposals in broader-impact-heavy programs like PFI and POSE suggest this is an area needing focused improvement.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The fusion of Dr. Costilla Reyes's expertise in AI-driven digital watermarking with blockchain technology for an educational context is a novel and compelling concept. He could pioneer systems for 'proof-of-learning' that are portable and owned by the student, create secure and verifiable lifelong learning portfolios, or develop platforms that enable under-resourced institutions to issue credible digital credentials, thus directly addressing the 'Broadening Participation' goal.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **BP_Watermarked_UIUC__RBPC___Altitut_.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: The core technology and value proposition around digital watermarking and asset protection from this business plan should be reframed from a commercial IP context to an educational one. Instead of protecting corporate designs, the goal becomes protecting and verifying student-created work or institutional credentials. The adaptation will involve replacing the business case with a 'broader impacts' case focused on how this technology empowers students, particularly from underserved groups, by giving them ownership and portability of their educational achievements.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical sections describing the watermarking algorithms, system architecture for asset management, and discussions on security and data integrity can be largely repurposed. The fundamental 'how it works' section is a strong foundation to build upon.

**Strategic Positioning:** The core strategy must be to bridge the gap between his technical expertise and the DCL's educational and social goals. This involves three key actions: 1) Frame the project around a clear, compelling educational challenge, such as creating verifiable, portable micro-credentials for students in community colleges to ease transfer to 4-year STEM programs. 2) **Form a genuine partnership with a co-PI or senior personnel from a College of Education or a non-profit focused on STEM access.** This is non-negotiable for credibility. 3) Since this is a DCL, identify a specific target program within an NSF directorate like TIP (e.g., Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems - POSE) or CISE (e.g., a core computer science program), and tailor the proposal to that program's specific requirements, using this DCL's theme as the central motivation.

#### Success Factors
- Forging a strong, integrated partnership with a co-PI who has documented expertise in STEM education and broadening participation research.
- Clearly articulating a novel application of watermarking/AI expertise to a specific educational challenge, such as creating verifiable micro-credentials or secure student portfolios.
- Designing the project with a 'use-inspired' approach that directly benefits a specific underserved community, ensuring the 'Broadening Participation' component is central to the project, not an add-on.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The researcher's profile shows no explicit experience in the education domain, which will make it difficult to write a proposal that is pedagogically sound and credible to reviewers from that field.
- While conceptually related, the profile lacks hands-on experience with specific blockchain protocols (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger). He will need to rapidly acquire this expertise or include a collaborator with it.
- A history of unsuccessful proposals in broader-impact focused programs (PFI, POSE, ExLENT) indicates a potential weakness in articulating and planning for societal impact and community building, which is the central thrust of this DCL.

### 94. Dynamics, Control and Systems Diagnostics (DCSD) (Score: 70)

**Program ID:** 506049  
**Compatibility Score:** 70/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match due to the researcher's direct expertise in anomaly detection (diagnostics) and ML for complex systems, but a successful proposal requires a significant strategic pivot from their demonstrated commercialization-focused background to the fundamental research valued by DCSD.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical skills align remarkably well with the core areas of the DCSD program. The strongest connection is between 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' and the program's 'Diagnostics' thrust. Expertise in 'Machine Learning at the Edge (Edge AI)', 'IoT', and 'Computer Vision in Manufacturing' provides a strong foundation for the 'Modeling' and 'Analysis' of complex, real-world dynamic systems. Furthermore, work in 'Manufacturing Quality Assurance' inherently involves 'Control' methods to produce desired behavior. The PI's skills in 'Explainable AI (XAI)' are a critical asset, as they can be used to create interpretable diagnostic and control models, a highly desirable feature in engineering systems.
- **Research Domain Match:** The researcher's domains of Computer Science, Engineering, and Machine Learning are at the forefront of modern approaches to dynamics and control. The application areas listed in the profile, such as 'Manufacturing Quality Assurance', 'Smart Agriculture Technologies', and 'Clean Energy', are excellent sources of the application-inspired fundamental research that DCSD seeks. The key is to frame projects within these domains around the fundamental scientific questions about the underlying system dynamics, rather than just the application's outcome.
- **Experience Relevance:** This is a mixed area. The PI's success in securing over $1.2M in funding demonstrates a proven ability to manage projects and write compelling narratives. However, the visible success is heavily concentrated in the NSF SBIR program (Small Business Innovation Research). SBIRs focus on commercialization, which has a very different objective and review criteria than a fundamental research program like DCSD. This history could lead reviewers to question if the PI's focus is on developing new knowledge (DCSD's goal) or new products. The list of unsuccessful proposals in other fundamental/translational programs (PFI, POSE) suggests a potential challenge in adapting their framing and style away from a commercial-centric approach.
- **Innovation Potential:** The potential for innovation is very high. The researcher is perfectly positioned to propose novel, data-driven methodologies for dynamic systems that complement or surpass traditional physics-based approaches. Proposing to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for system identification or XAI for creating trustworthy diagnostic tools in manufacturing would be highly innovative. The fusion of state-of-the-art AI/ML with the classical engineering problems central to DCSD is a fertile ground for high-impact, transformative research.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: Despite being unsuccessful, the topic is an excellent fit. The core adaptation is to shift the proposal's entire framing from the PFI (Partnerships for Innovation) goal of 'technology translation and partnership' to the DCSD goal of 'fundamental knowledge generation'. The research question must change from 'How can we build a tool for asset monitoring?' to 'What are the fundamental principles and mathematical frameworks required for robust anomaly detection in sparsely-observed, non-stationary dynamic systems, as exemplified by remote asset monitoring?'. The focus must be on the novelty of the algorithm and the new understanding it provides, not the commercial application.
  - Reusable Elements: The problem statement, literature review on outlier detection methods, and the description of the motivating application (remote asset monitoring) can likely be repurposed. The core technical approach can serve as a foundation, but it must be deepened with more theoretical development, formal analysis, and clearly defined knowledge-based research objectives.

**Strategic Positioning:** The PI must position themselves as a fundamental scientist who uses applications to motivate deep, foundational questions. The proposal narrative should explicitly de-emphasize commercial outcomes, products, and IP. Instead, it should highlight contributions to scientific knowledge, new theories, and novel algorithms. A powerful strategy would be to frame the work around 'Explainable AI for Dynamic Systems', arguing that current ML methods are black boxes and the proposed research will create a new class of interpretable diagnostic or control systems. Crucially, the PI must follow the program's advice and submit a one-page Project Summary to the Program Directors to validate this strategic pivot before investing in a full proposal.

#### Success Factors
- The direct and powerful alignment of 'Anomaly/Outlier Detection' expertise with the 'Diagnostics' thrust of the DCSD program.
- The high innovation potential of applying cutting-edge ML techniques (LLMs, XAI, Edge AI) to solve classical problems in dynamics and control.
- The ability to ground fundamental research in compelling, high-impact application domains like manufacturing or clean energy, which aligns with the 'application-inspired' nature of the program.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- Overcoming reviewer skepticism due to a funding history heavily focused on commercialization (SBIR). The proposal must rigorously demonstrate a commitment to fundamental research goals over product development.
- Bridging the gap between data-driven CS/ML expertise and the traditional theoretical foundations of the dynamics and control community. The proposal must show a sophisticated understanding of classical control/systems theory and clearly articulate how the proposed work extends or integrates with it.

### 95. Engineering for Civil Infrastructure (ECI) (Score: 70)

**Program ID:** 505488  
**Compatibility Score:** 70/100  
**Summary:** This is a strong potential match if the researcher's advanced AI/IoT expertise is strategically paired with a civil engineering collaborator to address the program's call for fundamental, convergent research on infrastructure resilience.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Technical Alignment:** The researcher's technical expertise in Anomaly/Outlier Detection, IoT, Edge AI, Computer Vision, and Energy Harvesting Systems is highly aligned with the computational and analytical aspects of the ECI program. These skills can be directly applied to develop novel methods for real-time structural health monitoring, post-disaster damage assessment, and predictive maintenance of civil infrastructure. For instance, Anomaly Detection and Edge AI can be used to process sensor data on structures to identify early signs of failure from extreme weather or seismic events. Computer Vision can automate the inspection of buildings and bridges, while energy harvesting can power long-term, low-maintenance sensor networks, addressing the program's interest in infrastructure behavior over its service lifetime.
- **Research Domain Match:** While the researcher's core domains are Computer Science and Machine Learning, the ECI program explicitly encourages 'convergent research' and lists 'artificial_intelligence' and 'cyberinfrastructure' as key research areas. This creates a clear point of entry. The researcher's profile fits the role of a co-PI bringing cutting-edge computational methods to a traditional engineering field. The challenge is bridging the gap between CS/ML and the ECI program's core disciplines (geotechnical, structural, materials engineering). The proposal must be fundamentally grounded in solving a civil engineering problem, not just applying an AI technique.
- **Experience Relevance:** With over $1.2M in funding and 7 successful proposals, the researcher has a proven track record of securing competitive funding, including from the NSF (as indicated by SBIR proposal filenames). This experience is a significant asset. Notably, the unsuccessful proposal `NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf` shows direct prior effort in a highly relevant area. This experience, though unsuccessful, provides a valuable foundation and demonstrates long-term interest. The 'Mid-Career Academic Entrepreneur' status aligns well with the NSF's emphasis on 'Broader Impacts,' as the research can be framed to have tangible benefits for community welfare and economic activity.
- **Innovation Potential:** The primary innovation potential lies in the fusion of state-of-the-art AI with civil engineering principles. The researcher can introduce novel approaches that move beyond traditional analytical models. For example, using Explainable AI (XAI) to understand why a model predicts a structural flaw could lead to new fundamental insights into material fatigue and failure modes. Applying Edge AI for on-site, real-time data processing during a hazard event (like an earthquake or hurricane) could create a new paradigm for adaptive infrastructure and emergency response, directly addressing the program's focus on disaster resilience.

#### Proposal Matching Recommendations

**Best Adaptable Proposals:**
- **NSF22_PFI_OutlierDetection_RemoteAssetMonitoring.pdf**
  - Adaptation Strategy: This unsuccessful PFI proposal is the ideal foundation. It must be reframed from its original translational/commercial focus (PFI program) to a fundamental research focus (ECI program). Instead of pitching a 'product' for asset monitoring, the proposal should pose a fundamental research question. For example: 'How can high-frequency, multi-modal sensor data processed via federated outlier detection advance the fundamental understanding of cascading failures in interdependent infrastructure systems?' This shifts the goal from building a tool to generating new scientific knowledge in civil engineering, using the tool as the research methodology. This requires partnering with a civil engineering PI who can ground the research questions in established theory and challenges.
  - Reusable Elements: The technical architecture for remote monitoring, the IoT and sensor integration plan, the core machine learning algorithms for outlier detection, and the preliminary data or use cases can likely be reused and expanded upon.

**Strategic Positioning:** The proposal must be positioned as a 'Convergent Research' project, with the researcher and a civil engineering collaborator as co-PIs. The narrative should not be 'applying AI to civil engineering' but rather 'creating new civil engineering knowledge through novel computational methods.' Emphasize how the proposed work addresses multiple ECI priorities simultaneously: for example, using AI-driven monitoring to enhance resilience to climate change-induced extreme weather (hurricanes, floods) and geologic hazards (earthquakes). The 'Broader Impacts' section should leverage the researcher's entrepreneurial background to discuss pathways to real-world application, promoting community safety and equitable infrastructure management.

#### Success Factors
- Form a genuine collaboration with a PI from a core ECI discipline (e.g., structural, geotechnical, or coastal engineering) to ensure the proposal is grounded in domain-specific theory and needs.
- Clearly articulate a fundamental research question that advances civil engineering science, rather than just developing an application or a tool.
- Explicitly connect the proposed research to the ECI program's key themes of 'climate change adaptation', 'hazards and disaster resilience', and 'sustainability over its service lifetime'.

#### Challenges and Gaps
- The researcher's primary expertise is in CS/ML, not the core civil engineering domains of the ECI program. Without a strong collaborator, the proposal will lack credibility with the review panel.
- The researcher's funding history (SBIR) and past attempts (PFI) are in translational/applied programs. There is a risk the proposal will be perceived as too applied for a fundamental research program like ECI. Careful reframing is critical to overcome this.
