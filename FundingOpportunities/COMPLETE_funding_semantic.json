          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials; Integrated Sensing and Cyber   OBJECTIVE: Develop and optimize designs for near-diffraction limited, near-infrared Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Lasers (PCSEL) laser diode arrays; a multi-element, surface-emitting, semiconductor laser structure with single-spatial-mode emission. Devices must output sufficient intensity to be used in various laser-based efforts for the U.S. Army, including solid state laser pumping and direct illumination across near-infrared wavelengths.   DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army uses lasers in many of its mission areas and would greatly benefit from a low cost, efficient laser source with high beam quality such as the PCSEL.  The Army uses Near Infrared (NIR) lasers, in conjunction with night vision goggles, during night operations for target pointing/marking, precision fires, and target handoff.  The NIR PCSEL can be developed to replace the existing edge emitter laser diode. The PCSEL device would be more compact, lighter weight, and less costly due to the PCSELs easy to manufacture planar structure, greatly improved beam quality, and reduced need for beam shaping and steering optics.   The Army also uses compact solid-state lasers in laser rangefinders, for target marking/handoff, designation, and threat detection. These lasers use doped glass or crystal that are pumped by edge-emitting laser diodes.  The edge-emitting lasers are highly asymmetric and highly divergent emission must be shaped by optical lenses in order to make it similar in profile to the round optical mode of the laser, as required to achieve good pump-mode overlap and high laser efficiency.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       This research effort will require the design and optimization and fabrication of proof-of-concept of NIR PCSELs for use in U.S. Army applications.  Develop PCSEL designs that meet program requirements as stated in the description portion of this topic, optimizing for beam quality. Results of modeling shall be provided as well as a manufacturing feasibility study. Metrics such as wavelength, power, duty cycle, efficiency, and beam quality should meet program objectives. Prior work in surface emitting laser diodes and photonic crystal meta-structures should be noted.   PHASE II: Fabricate and deliver >10 proof-of-concept PCSELs of several configurations (multiple near-infrared wavelengths and emitter areas) to validate model and allow selection of best design. These devices should demonstrate significantly improved (>10x) beam quality over existing commercial laser diodes. The packaging should allow them to be easily powered with existing laser diode drivers and integrated into a benchtop laser characterization system.

            "summary": "This U.S. Army STTR opportunity seeks to fund the development of next-generation Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Lasers (PCSELs) to replace conventional edge-emitting diodes in advanced military systems. The program targets near-infrared (NIR) PCSELs that are compact, low-cost, and exhibit near-diffraction-limited, single-spatial-mode beams with over 10 times the beam quality of current commercial devices. Applications include solid-state laser pumping, direct illumination, target designation, and Lidar. The project is phased, with Phase I ($250k, 6 months) focusing on the design, modeling, and manufacturing feasibility of novel PCSEL concepts. Phase II will involve the fabrication and delivery of proof-of-concept devices. This opportunity requires a formal partnership between a small business and a non-profit research institution. The goal is to mature this high-impact technology for transition into both military programs of record and commercial dual-use applications.",
            "capabilitiesNeeded": "Core capabilities must include: 1) Advanced photonic crystal design and simulation (e.g., FDTD, RCWA). 2) Semiconductor epitaxial growth (MOCVD/MBE). 3) Semiconductor device fabrication in a cleanroom environment. 4) Laser device characterization, including power, efficiency, and beam quality (M²) measurements. A strong project management and commercialization strategy is also essential.",
            "innovationPotential": "The innovation potential is extremely high, focusing on creating a disruptive laser source technology. Success would lead to significantly more compact, lighter, and higher-performance laser systems for defense and commercial sectors, overcoming fundamental limitations of existing laser diode technology.",
            "collaborationRequirements": "A formal STTR partnership between a U.S. small business and a U.S. non-profit research institution is mandatory. The proposal must clearly define the roles, responsibilities, and intellectual property arrangements between the partners. Evidence of a strong, pre-existing relationship is advantageous.",
            "fundingReadiness": "Applicants should be at a stage where they have a well-founded concept for a novel PCSEL design, backed by preliminary research or strong theoretical understanding. The team must be fully formed, and the STTR partnership established or imminent. Readiness to execute the 6-month Phase I plan immediately upon award is critical."

Devices must output sufficient intensity to be used in various laser-based efforts for the U.S. Army, including solid state laser pumping and direct illumination across near-infrared wavelengths.   DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army uses lasers in many of its mission areas and would greatly benefit from a low cost, efficient laser source with high beam quality such as the PCSEL.  The Army uses Near Infrared (NIR) lasers, in conjunction with night vision goggles, during night operations for target pointing/marking, precision fires, and target handoff.  The NIR PCSEL can be developed to replace the existing edge emitter laser diode. The PCSEL device would be more compact, lighter weight, and less costly due to the PCSELs easy to manufacture planar structure, greatly improved beam quality, and reduced need for beam shaping and steering optics.   The Army also uses compact solid-state lasers in laser rangefinders, for target marking/handoff, designation, and threat detection. These lasers use doped glass or crystal that are pumped by edge-emitting laser diodes.  The edge-emitting lasers are highly asymmetric and highly divergent emission must be shaped by optical lenses in order to make it similar in profile to the round optical mode of the laser, as required to achieve good pump-mode overlap and high laser efficiency.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       This research effort will require the design and optimization and fabrication of proof-of-concept of NIR PCSELs for use in U.S. Army applications.  Develop PCSEL designs that meet program requirements as stated in the description portion of this topic, optimizing for beam quality. Results of modeling shall be provided as well as a manufacturing feasibility study. Metrics such as wavelength, power, duty cycle, efficiency, and beam quality should meet program objectives.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an expendable low-cost separation system for space payload deployment agnostic of Launch Service Provider (LSP) and cargo container providers. The goal is to create concepts that prioritize affordability and sufficient reliability and quality without resorting to complex or specialized designs. Proposed solutions may include mechanical, electrical, explosive, or other innovative non-traditional methods, emphasizing simplicity and cost-effectiveness.   DESCRIPTION: This Phase I effort seeks to develop an expendable, low-cost separation system that is agnostic of Launch Service Providers (LSPs) and cargo container providers. The focus is on minimizing costs while ensuring sufficient reliability and quality without relying on complex or highly specialized designs. Proposed concepts may include mechanical, electrical, explosive, or other non-traditional methods. Emerging technological advancements provide a significant opportunity for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to enhance Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions through improved post-atmospheric reentry payload deployment. The production of separation systems is inherently complex and costly, with development traditionally limited to a small number of suppliers—restricting innovation and growth in the space industry. This initiative aims to shift away from costly, specialized designs toward innovative approaches in design, fabrication, and testing that support reliable payload survivability in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. The goal is to establish a versatile, expendable separation system compatible with any LSP and cargo container, broadening application across multiple space platforms and reducing the overall expense of payload deployment. Concepts should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and adequate reliability.   PHASE I: The objective of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost Separation System concept or conduct a comprehensive feasibility study assessing Separation System effectiveness relative to cost. This effort should explore innovative approaches that enable low cost, expendable, launch vehicle agnostic Separation System to enable survivability of payloads during atmospheric reentry, particularly for payload masses in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. Offerors should:   - Propose a clear technical approach for a Separation System or feasibility study of the Separation System performance with cost reduction.  - Include preliminary modeling, simulation, or experimental plans to evaluate Separation System characteristics.  - Identify key materials, fabrication methods, and production scalability considerations.  - Provide an initial assessment of manufacturing pathways and potential barriers to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  - Discuss potential risks and mitigation strategies related to Separation System performance, manufacturing, or cost.   Deliverables may include:  - A comprehensive feasibility study report detailing Separation System performance relative to cost.  - Conceptual designs or prototype descriptions illustrating the Separation System approach.  - Preliminary Separation System modeling or test data supporting performance claims.  - A manufacturing and fabrication pathway including material choices, production methods, and cost estimates.  - Identification of technical and production challenges, along with proposed solutions for Phase II development.   This Phase I effort will establish a foundational understanding and pathway for advancing the proposed Separation System solution toward LRIP and eventual operational use.   PHASE II: The Phase II effort will focus on advancing the research and development effort initiated in Phase I. The Phase II project aims at maturing the design and/or concept from the Phase I-like effort and possibly a prototype to conduct research and testing in lab and realistic environments to provide essential data to address any technical challenges, safety concerns, regulatory requirements, and/or other concerns. Awardee(s) should also identify any challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP).   The Phase II objective is to advance the development and maturation of the Separation System concept developed in Phase I. The goal is to create and demonstrate a prototype capable of meeting Separation System requirements for atmospheric reentry payloads in relevant operational environments, while addressing manufacturability, cost, and safety considerations.   Key Goals:  - Develop and refine Separation System designs or concepts based on Phase I findings.  - Fabricate a prototype system suitable for testing in laboratory and realistic operational conditions.  - Conduct rigorous testing to evaluate Separation System performance, structural integrity, durability, and compliance with safety and regulatory standards.  - Address technical challenges identified in Phase I, including material selection, fabrication methods, and integration strategies.  - Assess manufacturability and scalability to enable transition toward Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full-Rate Production (FRP).  - Identify and mitigate potential barriers to production, safety, and operational deployment.   Deliverables May Include:  - Detailed prototype design documentation and fabrication plans.  - Test plans and protocols for laboratory and operational environment evaluation.  - Comprehensive test reports documenting Separation System performance, safety, durability, and regulatory compliance.  - Updated risk assessment and mitigation strategies based on test results.  - Manufacturing and production feasibility studies, including cost analysis.  - Recommendations and pathways for LRIP and FRP phases, including any identified production or safety challenges.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort aims to demonstrate the separation system in an operational-like environment and achieve technology maturation and commercialization. The objective of Phase III is to demonstrate the expendable, low-cost separation system in an operational-like environment to achieve full technology maturation and enable commercialization. The effort will focus on validating system performance, reliability, and integration capabilities for both military and commercial space applications. Military applications:   - Provide the Department of the Air Force (DAF) and other DoD agencies with a reliable, cost-effective separation system compatible with multiple Launch Service Providers (LSPs) and cargo containers.  - Support Rocket Cargo materiel transport delivery missions, rapid deployment scenarios, and other space operations requiring expendable separation solutions.  - Enhance operational agility and reduce lifecycle costs associated with payload deployment and separation.  - Enable scalable production to meet increasing mission demands.   Commercial Applications:  - Facilitate flexible payload integration across a variety of commercial cargo containers and launch platforms.  - Reduce costs for commercial space operators by providing an expendable, simplified separation mechanism that maintains sufficient reliability and quality.   The end goal is to establish a versatile, low-cost, and expendable separation system that broadens the industrial base, reduces mission costs, and supports a wide range of military and commercial space materiel transport operations, fostering innovation and ensuring sustainable space mission success.

The initiative aims to address the high complexity and cost associated with current separation systems, which are produced by a limited number of suppliers. By focusing on innovative and simple designs—which may be mechanical, electrical, explosive, or non-traditional—the DAF hopes to foster innovation and expand the industrial base. A key application is the enhancement of Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions, requiring reliable post-atmospheric reentry deployment for payloads in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. The program is structured in three phases, moving from initial feasibility and conceptual design (Phase I), to prototype development and testing (Phase II), and ultimately to operational demonstration and dual-use commercialization (Phase III).",

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an expendable low-cost separation system for space payload deployment agnostic of Launch Service Provider (LSP) and cargo container providers. The goal is to create concepts that prioritize affordability and sufficient reliability and quality without resorting to complex or specialized designs. Proposed solutions may include mechanical, electrical, explosive, or other innovative non-traditional methods, emphasizing simplicity and cost-effectiveness.   DESCRIPTION: This Phase I effort seeks to develop an expendable, low-cost separation system that is agnostic of Launch Service Providers (LSPs) and cargo container providers. The focus is on minimizing costs while ensuring sufficient reliability and quality without relying on complex or highly specialized designs. Proposed concepts may include mechanical, electrical, explosive, or other non-traditional methods. Emerging technological advancements provide a significant opportunity for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to enhance Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions through improved post-atmospheric reentry payload deployment. The production of separation systems is inherently complex and costly, with development traditionally limited to a small number of suppliers—restricting innovation and growth in the space industry. This initiative aims to shift away from costly, specialized designs toward innovative approaches in design, fabrication, and testing that support reliable payload survivability in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. The goal is to establish a versatile, expendable separation system compatible with any LSP and cargo container, broadening application across multiple space platforms and reducing the overall expense of payload deployment. Concepts should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and adequate reliability.   PHASE I: The objective of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost Separation System concept or conduct a comprehensive feasibility study assessing Separation System effectiveness relative to cost. This effort should explore innovative approaches that enable low cost, expendable, launch vehicle agnostic Separation System to enable survivability of payloads during atmospheric reentry, particularly for payload masses in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. Offerors should:   - Propose a clear technical approach for a Separation System or feasibility study of the Separation System performance with cost reduction.  - Include preliminary modeling, simulation, or experimental plans to evaluate Separation System characteristics.  - Identify key materials, fabrication methods, and production scalability considerations.  - Provide an initial assessment of manufacturing pathways and potential barriers to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  - Discuss potential risks and mitigation strategies related to Separation System performance, manufacturing, or cost.   Deliverables may include:  - A comprehensive feasibility study report detailing Separation System performance relative to cost.  - Conceptual designs or prototype descriptions illustrating the Separation System approach.  - Preliminary Separation System modeling or test data supporting performance claims.  - A manufacturing and fabrication pathway including material choices, production methods, and cost estimates.  - Identification of technical and production challenges, along with proposed solutions for Phase II development.   This Phase I effort will establish a foundational understanding and pathway for advancing the proposed Separation System solution toward LRIP and eventual operational use.   PHASE II: The Phase II effort will focus on advancing the research and development effort initiated in Phase I. The Phase II project aims at maturing the design and/or concept from the Phase I-like effort and possibly a prototype to conduct research and testing in lab and realistic environments to provide essential data to address any technical challenges, safety concerns, regulatory requirements, and/or other concerns. Awardee(s) should also identify any challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP).   The Phase II objective is to advance the development and maturation of the Separation System concept developed in Phase I. The goal is to create and demonstrate a prototype capable of meeting Separation System requirements for atmospheric reentry payloads in relevant operational environments, while addressing manufacturability, cost, and safety considerations.   Key Goals:  - Develop and refine Separation System designs or concepts based on Phase I findings.  - Fabricate a prototype system suitable for testing in laboratory and realistic operational conditions.  - Conduct rigorous testing to evaluate Separation System performance, structural integrity, durability, and compliance with safety and regulatory standards.  - Address technical challenges identified in Phase I, including material selection, fabrication methods, and integration strategies.  - Assess manufacturability and scalability to enable transition toward Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full-Rate Production (FRP).  - Identify and mitigate potential barriers to production, safety, and operational deployment.   Deliverables May Include:  - Detailed prototype design documentation and fabrication plans.  - Test plans and protocols for laboratory and operational environment evaluation.  - Comprehensive test reports documenting Separation System performance, safety, durability, and regulatory compliance.  - Updated risk assessment and mitigation strategies based on test results.  - Manufacturing and production feasibility studies, including cost analysis.  - Recommendations and pathways for LRIP and FRP phases, including any identified production or safety challenges.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort aims to demonstrate the separation system in an operational-like environment and achieve technology maturation and commercialization. The objective of Phase III is to demonstrate the expendable, low-cost separation system in an operational-like environment to achieve full technology maturation and enable commercialization. The effort will focus on validating system performance, reliability, and integration capabilities for both military and commercial space applications. Military applications:   - Provide the Department of the Air Force (DAF) and other DoD agencies with a reliable, cost-effective separation system compatible with multiple Launch Service Providers (LSPs) and cargo containers.  - Support Rocket Cargo materiel transport delivery missions, rapid deployment scenarios, and other space operations requiring expendable separation solutions.  - Enhance operational agility and reduce lifecycle costs associated with payload deployment and separation.  - Enable scalable production to meet increasing mission demands.   Commercial Applications:  - Facilitate flexible payload integration across a variety of commercial cargo containers and launch platforms.  - Reduce costs for commercial space operators by providing an expendable, simplified separation mechanism that maintains sufficient reliability and quality.   The end goal is to establish a versatile, low-cost, and expendable separation system that broadens the industrial base, reduces mission costs, and supports a wide range of military and commercial space materiel transport operations, fostering innovation and ensuring sustainable space mission success.

Proposed solutions may include mechanical, electrical, explosive, or other innovative non-traditional methods, emphasizing simplicity and cost-effectiveness.   DESCRIPTION: This Phase I effort seeks to develop an expendable, low-cost separation system that is agnostic of Launch Service Providers (LSPs) and cargo container providers. The focus is on minimizing costs while ensuring sufficient reliability and quality without relying on complex or highly specialized designs. Proposed concepts may include mechanical, electrical, explosive, or other non-traditional methods. Emerging technological advancements provide a significant opportunity for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to enhance Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions through improved post-atmospheric reentry payload deployment. The production of separation systems is inherently complex and costly, with development traditionally limited to a small number of suppliers—restricting innovation and growth in the space industry. This initiative aims to shift away from costly, specialized designs toward innovative approaches in design, fabrication, and testing that support reliable payload survivability in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. The goal is to establish a versatile, expendable separation system compatible with any LSP and cargo container, broadening application across multiple space platforms and reducing the overall expense of payload deployment. Concepts should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and adequate reliability.   PHASE I: The objective of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost Separation System concept or conduct a comprehensive feasibility study assessing Separation System effectiveness relative to cost. This effort should explore innovative approaches that enable low cost, expendable, launch vehicle agnostic Separation System to enable survivability of payloads during atmospheric reentry, particularly for payload masses in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. Offerors should:   - Propose a clear technical approach for a Separation System or feasibility study of the Separation System performance with cost reduction.  - Include preliminary modeling, simulation, or experimental plans to evaluate Separation System characteristics.  - Identify key materials, fabrication methods, and production scalability considerations.  - Provide an initial assessment of manufacturing pathways and potential barriers to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  - Discuss potential risks and mitigation strategies related to Separation System performance, manufacturing, or cost.   Deliverables may include:  - A comprehensive feasibility study report detailing Separation System performance relative to cost.  - Conceptual designs or prototype descriptions illustrating the Separation System approach.  - Preliminary Separation System modeling or test data supporting performance claims.  - A manufacturing and fabrication pathway including material choices, production methods, and cost estimates.  - Identification of technical and production challenges, along with proposed solutions for Phase II development.   This Phase I effort will establish a foundational understanding and pathway for advancing the proposed Separation System solution toward LRIP and eventual operational use.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI & Autonomy   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an underwater sensor optimized for size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) that can be mounted on a small uncrewed boat to detect bathymetry and underwater hazards in shallow, bubbly environments.​   DESCRIPTION: There is an increasing need to enable U.S. Army sustainment and maneuver support operations through littoral environments, including shallow-water and surfzone based landings, in potentially contested regions. In particular, enabling maritime operations and autonomous distribution to support logistics over the shore for the Joint Forces was recently identified as an S&T priority. In these over-the-shore operations, mapping bathymetry and shallow water hazards (e.g., unexploded ordinance) are of primary importance to ensure safe, efficient, and effective force projection. On exposed coasts, bubbles from breaking waves are a typical environmental impediment that attenuate acoustic signals denying adequate sensing, which leaves crewed or uncrewed systems with limited situational awareness in a particularly challenging environment, arguably the most critical portion of any transit.​   Surfzone bubbles range in sizes, depending on whether they are part of the alpha plume (initial injection) with sizes ranging from cm to tens of micros or the gamma plume (resident plume of smaller bubbles), the both of which creates attenuation of acoustic signals (Deane G. B., 1997, 1999). Leighton (2010) highlighted methods to classify bubbles and reduce their clutter using a Twin Inverted Pair Sonar (TWIPS) signal, motivated by signals used by dolphins. This was examined in boat wakes by Leighton (2011). Lee (2016) highlights bubble’s non-linear response as a potential method for discerning bubbles from hard targets. Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least). Geometries should consider usage mounting on small uncrewed surface vehicles.   Deliver a reporting document: (1) a computer-aided design (CAD) model of developed technology(s) (2) the experimental procedures and results that demonstrate the process meets the performance requirements; (3) the developed system. A favorable performance evaluation will lead into Phase III applications. All research, development, and prototype designs shall be documented with detailed descriptions and specifications of the composition, fabrication, microstructure, and mechanical performance of the prototype repair materials.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a strong commercial hydrographic survey industry that could benefit from this technology. Hydrographic surveys are required as part of every USACE Civil Works beach and navigation project nationally, and are used widely within the commercial dredging industry and maritime safety industries.  Presently, operation in the surf-zone is constrained to low or non-breaking wave conditions, meaning the ability to collect these data are significantly weather-constrained.         REFERENCES:    https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/102/5/2671/558076/Sound-generation-and-air-entrainment-by-breaking   https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/29/7/1520-0485_1999_029_1393_aepabs_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display   https://pubs.aip.org/as       KEYWORDS: Surf Zone; Autonomy; Landing; Acoustics; Bubbles; Sensing; Underwater Sensing; Acoustic Sensors",

The primary challenge is the attenuation of conventional acoustic signals by bubbles generated by breaking waves in the surf zone, which denies situational awareness for autonomous and crewed systems during littoral transit and landings. The goal is to develop an underwater sensor optimized for Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) that can be mounted on small USVs. This sensor must provide real-time seafloor mapping and detect underwater hazards (e.g., unexploded ordnance) through these bubble plumes. The program encourages innovative approaches, including advanced acoustic signal processing (referencing techniques like TWIPS, non-linear acoustics, and doppler shifting) as well as non-acoustic sensing modalities. The final system must be ruggedized to withstand high hydrodynamic loading and provide data through standard protocols for real-time navigation.",

          "Topic Title": "Underwater Sensing in Surf Zone Environments",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI & Autonomy   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an underwater sensor optimized for size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) that can be mounted on a small uncrewed boat to detect bathymetry and underwater hazards in shallow, bubbly environments.​   DESCRIPTION: There is an increasing need to enable U.S. Army sustainment and maneuver support operations through littoral environments, including shallow-water and surfzone based landings, in potentially contested regions. In particular, enabling maritime operations and autonomous distribution to support logistics over the shore for the Joint Forces was recently identified as an S&T priority. In these over-the-shore operations, mapping bathymetry and shallow water hazards (e.g., unexploded ordinance) are of primary importance to ensure safe, efficient, and effective force projection. On exposed coasts, bubbles from breaking waves are a typical environmental impediment that attenuate acoustic signals denying adequate sensing, which leaves crewed or uncrewed systems with limited situational awareness in a particularly challenging environment, arguably the most critical portion of any transit.​   Surfzone bubbles range in sizes, depending on whether they are part of the alpha plume (initial injection) with sizes ranging from cm to tens of micros or the gamma plume (resident plume of smaller bubbles), the both of which creates attenuation of acoustic signals (Deane G. B., 1997, 1999). Leighton (2010) highlighted methods to classify bubbles and reduce their clutter using a Twin Inverted Pair Sonar (TWIPS) signal, motivated by signals used by dolphins. This was examined in boat wakes by Leighton (2011). Lee (2016) highlights bubble’s non-linear response as a potential method for discerning bubbles from hard targets. Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least). Geometries should consider usage mounting on small uncrewed surface vehicles.   Deliver a reporting document: (1) a computer-aided design (CAD) model of developed technology(s) (2) the experimental procedures and results that demonstrate the process meets the performance requirements; (3) the developed system. A favorable performance evaluation will lead into Phase III applications. All research, development, and prototype designs shall be documented with detailed descriptions and specifications of the composition, fabrication, microstructure, and mechanical performance of the prototype repair materials.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a strong commercial hydrographic survey industry that could benefit from this technology. Hydrographic surveys are required as part of every USACE Civil Works beach and navigation project nationally, and are used widely within the commercial dredging industry and maritime safety industries.  Presently, operation in the surf-zone is constrained to low or non-breaking wave conditions, meaning the ability to collect these data are significantly weather-constrained.         REFERENCES:    https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/102/5/2671/558076/Sound-generation-and-air-entrainment-by-breaking   https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/29/7/1520-0485_1999_029_1393_aepabs_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display   https://pubs.aip.org/as       KEYWORDS: Surf Zone; Autonomy; Landing; Acoustics; Bubbles; Sensing; Underwater Sensing; Acoustic Sensors",

In particular, enabling maritime operations and autonomous distribution to support logistics over the shore for the Joint Forces was recently identified as an S&T priority. In these over-the-shore operations, mapping bathymetry and shallow water hazards (e.g., unexploded ordinance) are of primary importance to ensure safe, efficient, and effective force projection. On exposed coasts, bubbles from breaking waves are a typical environmental impediment that attenuate acoustic signals denying adequate sensing, which leaves crewed or uncrewed systems with limited situational awareness in a particularly challenging environment, arguably the most critical portion of any transit.​   Surfzone bubbles range in sizes, depending on whether they are part of the alpha plume (initial injection) with sizes ranging from cm to tens of micros or the gamma plume (resident plume of smaller bubbles), the both of which creates attenuation of acoustic signals (Deane G. B., 1997, 1999). Leighton (2010) highlighted methods to classify bubbles and reduce their clutter using a Twin Inverted Pair Sonar (TWIPS) signal, motivated by signals used by dolphins. This was examined in boat wakes by Leighton (2011). Lee (2016) highlights bubble’s non-linear response as a potential method for discerning bubbles from hard targets. Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least).

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate a modular, autonomous or semi-autonomous material handling system capable of loading, transporting, and unloading heavy military cargo in support of expeditionary space logistics missions. The solution should be air- and space-transportable, compatible with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) cargo handling platforms, and capable of operating on both improved surfaces and austere terrain with minimal infrastructure. The system must be rugged, durable, and capable of supporting distributed operations in extreme environmental conditions while enhancing logistics agility, mission responsiveness, and safety in support of U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment objectives.   DESCRIPTION: Space logistics operations—including launch, landing, and transshipment—require material handling equipment (MHE) that can function in environments with little to no infrastructure. Traditional MHE platforms are not optimized for the unique mobility, durability, and transportability requirements of these missions, particularly in remote or contested locations where rapid deployment and turnaround are critical. To address this gap, the USSF and Space Systems Command (SSC) seek the development of a rugged, modular, and air-transportable MHE system capable of autonomously or semi-autonomously loading, moving, and unloading heavy military cargo. The system should support operations across a range of platforms and environments, enabling expeditionary sustainment for emerging space access and mobility missions. The solution should be capable of:   - Lifting and maneuvering standard cargo formats, including 463L pallets (up to 10,355 lbs.) and 20-foot ISO containers (up to 20,000 lbs.);   - Operating in austere terrain such as sand, mud, hills, and unprepared surfaces;  - Supporting multiple control modes: manual, joystick-operated, and autonomous;  - Being self-loadable/unloadable and air-transportable in C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft;  - Integrating with existing DoD cargo handling systems and container formats;  - Including sensor suites (e.g., cameras, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote control interfaces) to support operator safety and situational awareness;  - Withstanding harsh environmental conditions (e.g., electromagnetic interference (EMI) exposure, extreme temperatures, high humidity, corrosion-prone environments);  - Utilizing modular rollers, rails, and winches for flexible cargo control and rapid field maintenance.   Testing and demonstration of the prototype are anticipated at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (SFS) and/or Vandenberg Space Force Base (SFB) to validate the system’s performance under operationally realistic conditions. This topic seeks a Minimal Viable Solution (MVS) that delivers functional autonomy, transportability, and ruggedization while supporting distributed logistics, energy efficiency, and the sustainment posture outlined in the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: This Phase II effort aims to design, develop, and demonstrate a full-scale, modular material handling equipment (MHE) system capable of autonomously or semi-autonomously executing cargo loading, transport, and unloading operations in support of space logistics missions. The prototype should be tested under relevant environmental and operational conditions to validate its effectiveness in austere and infrastructure-limited environments such as spaceports, launchpads, and forward operating locations. This effort will emphasize system ruggedness, transportability, operational flexibility, and integration with current DoD logistics platforms, supporting rapid deployment and enhanced sustainment capabilities for the USSF. Expected capabilities include:   - Lift and maneuver standard 463L pallets and 20-ft ISO containers  - Operate autonomously or via manual/joystick control in austere terrain  - Self-load/unload into C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft  - Endure extreme environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, corrosion, EMI)  - Support modular maintenance and scalable upgrades  - Provide operator safety through integrated sensors and remote-control functionality   Deliverables may include:  - A fully functional, fieldable prototype of the MHE platform  - Integrated autonomy and control systems with multi-mode operations  - Technical data package including CAD files, system architecture, and interface control documentation   Testing reports documenting include:  - Maneuverability and terrain performance  - Environmental durability (e.g., thermal range, corrosion, EMI tolerance)  - Field demonstration at SSC, Cape Canaveral SFS, or Vandenberg SFB  - Integration roadmap for connecting with DoD cargo management platforms and logistics workflows   This Phase II effort should result in a prototype that is scalable, maintainable, and ready for operational assessment under realistic mission scenarios, ultimately supporting the goal of distributed, energy-efficient space logistics.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The developed material handling equipment (MHE) system is expected to transition into operational use across USSF, U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), and other DoD logistics units. Its ability to autonomously manage cargo movement in infrastructure-limited environments supports key mission areas such as:   - Expeditionary air and space logistics  - Launch and recovery site cargo handling  - Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and Distributed Operations  - Rapid transshipment at Space Mobility nodes   The Phase III system will enable secure, autonomous or semi-autonomous loading/unloading of critical assets at launchpads, forward operating locations, and contested logistics zones. Commercial applications include:   - The system also holds strong commercial potential, with applications in industries and scenarios that require autonomous heavy cargo handling in rugged or remote environments, including:  - Spaceport and aerospace logistics operations  - Emergency response and humanitarian aid delivery  - Remote construction, mining, or energy site logistics  - Commercial freight terminals requiring modular autonomous MHE   Key Performance Characteristics Targeted for Operational Transition include:  - Capable of lifting and transporting payloads up to 20,000 lbs.   - Operates in autonomous, semi-autonomous (joystick), or remote-control modes  - Functions for 5+ continuous hours under operational loads  - Operates in -60°F to 125°F temperatures with up to 100% humidity  - Capable of maneuvering on 17% inclines, executing 90° turns at 3 MPH  - Compliant with C5 corrosion resistance classification  - Equipped with modular roller and rail systems for efficient container handling  - Integrated 360° situational awareness via sensors and camera systems  - Supports dual-voltage charging (110V–240V) for global deployment compatibility   For the transition strategy, consider military adoption through SSC, USTRANSCOM, and Combatant Command logistics units and civilian adoption through partnerships with logistics providers, spaceport operators, emergency response agencies, and industrial automation companies. Technology readiness targeted at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or 9, with system ready for full-scale production and integration into DoD and commercial operations.   REFERENCES:   1.

          "Topic Title": "Autonomous Modular Material Handling Equipment for Space Logistics Operations",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate a modular, autonomous or semi-autonomous material handling system capable of loading, transporting, and unloading heavy military cargo in support of expeditionary space logistics missions. The solution should be air- and space-transportable, compatible with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) cargo handling platforms, and capable of operating on both improved surfaces and austere terrain with minimal infrastructure. The system must be rugged, durable, and capable of supporting distributed operations in extreme environmental conditions while enhancing logistics agility, mission responsiveness, and safety in support of U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment objectives.   DESCRIPTION: Space logistics operations—including launch, landing, and transshipment—require material handling equipment (MHE) that can function in environments with little to no infrastructure. Traditional MHE platforms are not optimized for the unique mobility, durability, and transportability requirements of these missions, particularly in remote or contested locations where rapid deployment and turnaround are critical. To address this gap, the USSF and Space Systems Command (SSC) seek the development of a rugged, modular, and air-transportable MHE system capable of autonomously or semi-autonomously loading, moving, and unloading heavy military cargo. The system should support operations across a range of platforms and environments, enabling expeditionary sustainment for emerging space access and mobility missions. The solution should be capable of:   - Lifting and maneuvering standard cargo formats, including 463L pallets (up to 10,355 lbs.) and 20-foot ISO containers (up to 20,000 lbs.);   - Operating in austere terrain such as sand, mud, hills, and unprepared surfaces;  - Supporting multiple control modes: manual, joystick-operated, and autonomous;  - Being self-loadable/unloadable and air-transportable in C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft;  - Integrating with existing DoD cargo handling systems and container formats;  - Including sensor suites (e.g., cameras, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote control interfaces) to support operator safety and situational awareness;  - Withstanding harsh environmental conditions (e.g., electromagnetic interference (EMI) exposure, extreme temperatures, high humidity, corrosion-prone environments);  - Utilizing modular rollers, rails, and winches for flexible cargo control and rapid field maintenance.   Testing and demonstration of the prototype are anticipated at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (SFS) and/or Vandenberg Space Force Base (SFB) to validate the system’s performance under operationally realistic conditions. This topic seeks a Minimal Viable Solution (MVS) that delivers functional autonomy, transportability, and ruggedization while supporting distributed logistics, energy efficiency, and the sustainment posture outlined in the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: This Phase II effort aims to design, develop, and demonstrate a full-scale, modular material handling equipment (MHE) system capable of autonomously or semi-autonomously executing cargo loading, transport, and unloading operations in support of space logistics missions. The prototype should be tested under relevant environmental and operational conditions to validate its effectiveness in austere and infrastructure-limited environments such as spaceports, launchpads, and forward operating locations. This effort will emphasize system ruggedness, transportability, operational flexibility, and integration with current DoD logistics platforms, supporting rapid deployment and enhanced sustainment capabilities for the USSF. Expected capabilities include:   - Lift and maneuver standard 463L pallets and 20-ft ISO containers  - Operate autonomously or via manual/joystick control in austere terrain  - Self-load/unload into C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft  - Endure extreme environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, corrosion, EMI)  - Support modular maintenance and scalable upgrades  - Provide operator safety through integrated sensors and remote-control functionality   Deliverables may include:  - A fully functional, fieldable prototype of the MHE platform  - Integrated autonomy and control systems with multi-mode operations  - Technical data package including CAD files, system architecture, and interface control documentation   Testing reports documenting include:  - Maneuverability and terrain performance  - Environmental durability (e.g., thermal range, corrosion, EMI tolerance)  - Field demonstration at SSC, Cape Canaveral SFS, or Vandenberg SFB  - Integration roadmap for connecting with DoD cargo management platforms and logistics workflows   This Phase II effort should result in a prototype that is scalable, maintainable, and ready for operational assessment under realistic mission scenarios, ultimately supporting the goal of distributed, energy-efficient space logistics.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The developed material handling equipment (MHE) system is expected to transition into operational use across USSF, U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), and other DoD logistics units. Its ability to autonomously manage cargo movement in infrastructure-limited environments supports key mission areas such as:   - Expeditionary air and space logistics  - Launch and recovery site cargo handling  - Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and Distributed Operations  - Rapid transshipment at Space Mobility nodes   The Phase III system will enable secure, autonomous or semi-autonomous loading/unloading of critical assets at launchpads, forward operating locations, and contested logistics zones. Commercial applications include:   - The system also holds strong commercial potential, with applications in industries and scenarios that require autonomous heavy cargo handling in rugged or remote environments, including:  - Spaceport and aerospace logistics operations  - Emergency response and humanitarian aid delivery  - Remote construction, mining, or energy site logistics  - Commercial freight terminals requiring modular autonomous MHE   Key Performance Characteristics Targeted for Operational Transition include:  - Capable of lifting and transporting payloads up to 20,000 lbs.   - Operates in autonomous, semi-autonomous (joystick), or remote-control modes  - Functions for 5+ continuous hours under operational loads  - Operates in -60°F to 125°F temperatures with up to 100% humidity  - Capable of maneuvering on 17% inclines, executing 90° turns at 3 MPH  - Compliant with C5 corrosion resistance classification  - Equipped with modular roller and rail systems for efficient container handling  - Integrated 360° situational awareness via sensors and camera systems  - Supports dual-voltage charging (110V–240V) for global deployment compatibility   For the transition strategy, consider military adoption through SSC, USTRANSCOM, and Combatant Command logistics units and civilian adoption through partnerships with logistics providers, spaceport operators, emergency response agencies, and industrial automation companies. Technology readiness targeted at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or 9, with system ready for full-scale production and integration into DoD and commercial operations.   REFERENCES:   1.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate a modular, autonomous or semi-autonomous material handling system capable of loading, transporting, and unloading heavy military cargo in support of expeditionary space logistics missions. The solution should be air- and space-transportable, compatible with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) cargo handling platforms, and capable of operating on both improved surfaces and austere terrain with minimal infrastructure. The system must be rugged, durable, and capable of supporting distributed operations in extreme environmental conditions while enhancing logistics agility, mission responsiveness, and safety in support of U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment objectives.   DESCRIPTION: Space logistics operations—including launch, landing, and transshipment—require material handling equipment (MHE) that can function in environments with little to no infrastructure. Traditional MHE platforms are not optimized for the unique mobility, durability, and transportability requirements of these missions, particularly in remote or contested locations where rapid deployment and turnaround are critical. To address this gap, the USSF and Space Systems Command (SSC) seek the development of a rugged, modular, and air-transportable MHE system capable of autonomously or semi-autonomously loading, moving, and unloading heavy military cargo. The system should support operations across a range of platforms and environments, enabling expeditionary sustainment for emerging space access and mobility missions. The solution should be capable of:   - Lifting and maneuvering standard cargo formats, including 463L pallets (up to 10,355 lbs.) and 20-foot ISO containers (up to 20,000 lbs.);   - Operating in austere terrain such as sand, mud, hills, and unprepared surfaces;  - Supporting multiple control modes: manual, joystick-operated, and autonomous;  - Being self-loadable/unloadable and air-transportable in C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft;  - Integrating with existing DoD cargo handling systems and container formats;  - Including sensor suites (e.g., cameras, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote control interfaces) to support operator safety and situational awareness;  - Withstanding harsh environmental conditions (e.g., electromagnetic interference (EMI) exposure, extreme temperatures, high humidity, corrosion-prone environments);  - Utilizing modular rollers, rails, and winches for flexible cargo control and rapid field maintenance.   Testing and demonstration of the prototype are anticipated at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (SFS) and/or Vandenberg Space Force Base (SFB) to validate the system’s performance under operationally realistic conditions. This topic seeks a Minimal Viable Solution (MVS) that delivers functional autonomy, transportability, and ruggedization while supporting distributed logistics, energy efficiency, and the sustainment posture outlined in the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: This Phase II effort aims to design, develop, and demonstrate a full-scale, modular material handling equipment (MHE) system capable of autonomously or semi-autonomously executing cargo loading, transport, and unloading operations in support of space logistics missions. The prototype should be tested under relevant environmental and operational conditions to validate its effectiveness in austere and infrastructure-limited environments such as spaceports, launchpads, and forward operating locations. This effort will emphasize system ruggedness, transportability, operational flexibility, and integration with current DoD logistics platforms, supporting rapid deployment and enhanced sustainment capabilities for the USSF. Expected capabilities include:   - Lift and maneuver standard 463L pallets and 20-ft ISO containers  - Operate autonomously or via manual/joystick control in austere terrain  - Self-load/unload into C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft  - Endure extreme environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, corrosion, EMI)  - Support modular maintenance and scalable upgrades  - Provide operator safety through integrated sensors and remote-control functionality   Deliverables may include:  - A fully functional, fieldable prototype of the MHE platform  - Integrated autonomy and control systems with multi-mode operations  - Technical data package including CAD files, system architecture, and interface control documentation   Testing reports documenting include:  - Maneuverability and terrain performance  - Environmental durability (e.g., thermal range, corrosion, EMI tolerance)  - Field demonstration at SSC, Cape Canaveral SFS, or Vandenberg SFB  - Integration roadmap for connecting with DoD cargo management platforms and logistics workflows   This Phase II effort should result in a prototype that is scalable, maintainable, and ready for operational assessment under realistic mission scenarios, ultimately supporting the goal of distributed, energy-efficient space logistics.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The developed material handling equipment (MHE) system is expected to transition into operational use across USSF, U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), and other DoD logistics units. Its ability to autonomously manage cargo movement in infrastructure-limited environments supports key mission areas such as:   - Expeditionary air and space logistics  - Launch and recovery site cargo handling  - Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and Distributed Operations  - Rapid transshipment at Space Mobility nodes   The Phase III system will enable secure, autonomous or semi-autonomous loading/unloading of critical assets at launchpads, forward operating locations, and contested logistics zones. Commercial applications include:   - The system also holds strong commercial potential, with applications in industries and scenarios that require autonomous heavy cargo handling in rugged or remote environments, including:  - Spaceport and aerospace logistics operations  - Emergency response and humanitarian aid delivery  - Remote construction, mining, or energy site logistics  - Commercial freight terminals requiring modular autonomous MHE   Key Performance Characteristics Targeted for Operational Transition include:  - Capable of lifting and transporting payloads up to 20,000 lbs.   - Operates in autonomous, semi-autonomous (joystick), or remote-control modes  - Functions for 5+ continuous hours under operational loads  - Operates in -60°F to 125°F temperatures with up to 100% humidity  - Capable of maneuvering on 17% inclines, executing 90° turns at 3 MPH  - Compliant with C5 corrosion resistance classification  - Equipped with modular roller and rail systems for efficient container handling  - Integrated 360° situational awareness via sensors and camera systems  - Supports dual-voltage charging (110V–240V) for global deployment compatibility   For the transition strategy, consider military adoption through SSC, USTRANSCOM, and Combatant Command logistics units and civilian adoption through partnerships with logistics providers, spaceport operators, emergency response agencies, and industrial automation companies. Technology readiness targeted at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or 9, with system ready for full-scale production and integration into DoD and commercial operations.   REFERENCES:   1.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials; Integrated Sensing and Cyber   OBJECTIVE: Develop and optimize designs for near-diffraction limited, near-infrared Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Lasers (PCSEL) laser diode arrays; a multi-element, surface-emitting, semiconductor laser structure with single-spatial-mode emission. Devices must output sufficient intensity to be used in various laser-based efforts for the U.S. Army, including solid state laser pumping and direct illumination across near-infrared wavelengths.   DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army uses lasers in many of its mission areas and would greatly benefit from a low cost, efficient laser source with high beam quality such as the PCSEL.  The Army uses Near Infrared (NIR) lasers, in conjunction with night vision goggles, during night operations for target pointing/marking, precision fires, and target handoff.  The NIR PCSEL can be developed to replace the existing edge emitter laser diode. The PCSEL device would be more compact, lighter weight, and less costly due to the PCSELs easy to manufacture planar structure, greatly improved beam quality, and reduced need for beam shaping and steering optics.    The Army also uses compact solid-state lasers in laser rangefinders, for target marking/handoff, designation, and threat detection. These lasers use doped glass or crystal that are pumped by edge-emitting laser diodes.  The edge-emitting lasers are highly asymmetric and highly divergent emission must be shaped by optical lenses in order to make it similar in profile to the round optical mode of the laser, as required to achieve good pump-mode overlap and high laser efficiency.  This requirement for shaping optics increases the overall cost and size of the laser.  In addition, edge emitting diodes are susceptible to optical damage by the laser emission and are very costly to fabricate because of the inherently complex manufacturing process requiring dicing of the wafer, facet coating, precise mounting of each chip on a heat-sink, and stacking multiple diode chips for high power arrays.   All of these deficiencies of the edge-emitting laser diode are overcome by the PCSEL:  first, the PCSEL structure is planar so that precise heat-sink mounting is not required, enabling low-cost fabrication. Second, its emission is highly collimated and symmetric so that it can be coupled directly into the doped glass without using any intermediate lenses required for beam shaping, thereby reducing laser complexity, cost, and size.  Third, because of its distributed emission area PCSELs are much less susceptible to optical damage, eliminating the need for optical filters that typically have to be placed between an edge emitting pump laser and the active laser glass or crystal.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       This research effort will require the design and optimization and fabrication of proof-of-concept of NIR PCSELs for use in U.S. Army applications.  Develop PCSEL designs that meet program requirements as stated in the description portion of this topic, optimizing for beam quality. Results of modeling shall be provided as well as a manufacturing feasibility study. Metrics such as wavelength, power, duty cycle, efficiency, and beam quality should meet program objectives. Prior work in surface emitting laser diodes and photonic crystal meta-structures should be noted.   PHASE II: Fabricate and deliver >10 proof-of-concept PCSELs of several configurations (multiple near-infrared wavelengths and emitter areas) to validate model and allow selection of best design. These devices should demonstrate significantly improved (>10x) beam quality over existing commercial laser diodes. The packaging should allow them to be easily powered with existing laser diode drivers and integrated into a benchtop laser characterization system.

These legacy lasers suffer from poor beam quality requiring complex and costly optics, susceptibility to optical damage, and a complex, expensive manufacturing process. This solicitation calls for the development of Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Lasers (PCSELs) as a superior alternative. PCSELs offer a planar structure for low-cost, scalable manufacturing and simplified thermal management. Their surface emission produces a highly collimated, symmetric beam, which can eliminate the need for shaping optics when pumping solid-state lasers or for direct illumination, thereby reducing the size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of Army laser systems. This program aims to leverage PCSEL technology for applications such as target pointing/marking, precision fires, laser rangefinding, and threat detection across near-infrared wavelengths.",

          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials; Integrated Sensing and Cyber   OBJECTIVE: Develop and optimize designs for near-diffraction limited, near-infrared Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Lasers (PCSEL) laser diode arrays; a multi-element, surface-emitting, semiconductor laser structure with single-spatial-mode emission. Devices must output sufficient intensity to be used in various laser-based efforts for the U.S. Army, including solid state laser pumping and direct illumination across near-infrared wavelengths.   DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army uses lasers in many of its mission areas and would greatly benefit from a low cost, efficient laser source with high beam quality such as the PCSEL.  The Army uses Near Infrared (NIR) lasers, in conjunction with night vision goggles, during night operations for target pointing/marking, precision fires, and target handoff.  The NIR PCSEL can be developed to replace the existing edge emitter laser diode. The PCSEL device would be more compact, lighter weight, and less costly due to the PCSELs easy to manufacture planar structure, greatly improved beam quality, and reduced need for beam shaping and steering optics.    The Army also uses compact solid-state lasers in laser rangefinders, for target marking/handoff, designation, and threat detection. These lasers use doped glass or crystal that are pumped by edge-emitting laser diodes.  The edge-emitting lasers are highly asymmetric and highly divergent emission must be shaped by optical lenses in order to make it similar in profile to the round optical mode of the laser, as required to achieve good pump-mode overlap and high laser efficiency.  This requirement for shaping optics increases the overall cost and size of the laser.  In addition, edge emitting diodes are susceptible to optical damage by the laser emission and are very costly to fabricate because of the inherently complex manufacturing process requiring dicing of the wafer, facet coating, precise mounting of each chip on a heat-sink, and stacking multiple diode chips for high power arrays.   All of these deficiencies of the edge-emitting laser diode are overcome by the PCSEL:  first, the PCSEL structure is planar so that precise heat-sink mounting is not required, enabling low-cost fabrication. Second, its emission is highly collimated and symmetric so that it can be coupled directly into the doped glass without using any intermediate lenses required for beam shaping, thereby reducing laser complexity, cost, and size.  Third, because of its distributed emission area PCSELs are much less susceptible to optical damage, eliminating the need for optical filters that typically have to be placed between an edge emitting pump laser and the active laser glass or crystal.

Devices must output sufficient intensity to be used in various laser-based efforts for the U.S. Army, including solid state laser pumping and direct illumination across near-infrared wavelengths.   DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army uses lasers in many of its mission areas and would greatly benefit from a low cost, efficient laser source with high beam quality such as the PCSEL.  The Army uses Near Infrared (NIR) lasers, in conjunction with night vision goggles, during night operations for target pointing/marking, precision fires, and target handoff.  The NIR PCSEL can be developed to replace the existing edge emitter laser diode. The PCSEL device would be more compact, lighter weight, and less costly due to the PCSELs easy to manufacture planar structure, greatly improved beam quality, and reduced need for beam shaping and steering optics.    The Army also uses compact solid-state lasers in laser rangefinders, for target marking/handoff, designation, and threat detection. These lasers use doped glass or crystal that are pumped by edge-emitting laser diodes.  The edge-emitting lasers are highly asymmetric and highly divergent emission must be shaped by optical lenses in order to make it similar in profile to the round optical mode of the laser, as required to achieve good pump-mode overlap and high laser efficiency.  This requirement for shaping optics increases the overall cost and size of the laser.  In addition, edge emitting diodes are susceptible to optical damage by the laser emission and are very costly to fabricate because of the inherently complex manufacturing process requiring dicing of the wafer, facet coating, precise mounting of each chip on a heat-sink, and stacking multiple diode chips for high power arrays.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Space Technology   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to investigate novel innovative concepts of low-cost expendable exterior Thermal Protection Solutions or internal thermal management solutions for atmospheric reentry containers. The concepts should focus on low-cost solutions whether it be developing a new passive solution (or material) or taking existing products (like Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC)) and lowering the cost. The proposed concepts can include either passive systems, active cooling, or non-traditional options.   The intent is to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solutions (TPS) or internal thermal management concepts for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. The focus is on identifying and characterizing materials, configurations, or cooling methods—either novel or modified from existing systems (e.g., PICA, RCC)—that provide adequate thermal protection at significantly reduced cost. Phase I aims to validate the thermal performance-to-cost trade space through modeling, small-scale testing, or analytical studies. Proposed solutions should emphasize manufacturability, scalability, and suitability for protecting payloads in the 1–10 metric ton class. Passive, active, or hybrid approaches are welcome, provided they show a clear path to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and system integration potential in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions by enabling the ability to operate after atmospheric reentry. A key objective of this effort is to help advance and reshape the commercial external thermal protection solution and/or internal thermal management solution industrial base(s) from one focused on high performance and expensive thermal protection solutions that deliver small mass to one focused on good performance and lower costs that still enables survivability of the payload in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. This might require novel new approaches to the design, fabrication, and/or testing of the external thermal protection solution or multiple Thermal Protection Solutions. The DAF is seeking to avoid the cost and inflexibility created by developing specialty solutions for this regime. External protections can be expendable as long as the contents inside the containers survive.   The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is pursuing new opportunities for Rocket Cargo materiel transport that require payload survivability following atmospheric reentry—without the cost or complexity of human-rated Thermal Protection Systems (TPS). Current TPS technologies are often over-engineered and cost-prohibitive for cargo-class missions, particularly in the 1 to 10 metric ton payload range. This topic seeks innovative, low-cost, expendable external TPS or internal thermal management solutions for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. Solutions may include new passive materials, active cooling systems, or modified commercial off-the-shelf technologies such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) adapted for affordability.  The objective is to reshape the industrial base from one centered on exquisite performance to one optimized for cost-effective survivability of critical payloads. Proposed approaches should emphasize manufacturability, repeatability, and integration potential for materiel transport missions. Expendability is acceptable so long as the payload remains intact and functional post-reentry. Novel design, fabrication, and testing strategies are encouraged, especially those that reduce thermal protection cost without compromising safety or performance in realistic reentry environments.   PHASE I: This Phase I effort will demonstrate a concept for a low-cost Thermal Protection Solution idea or conduct a feasibility study that is capable of showing the thermal protection properties in relation to the cost. Awardee(s) should also identify a viable route to manufacture or fabricate their proposed solution and/or identify challenges to get to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) processes in Phase II. The objective of Phase I is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solution (TPS) or internal thermal management system designed for atmospheric reentry of space cargo containers. The focus should be on proving the thermal performance of the concept relative to its cost, particularly for non-human rated, 1–10 metric ton payloads used in Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. Offerors should:   - Explore novel materials, passive or active thermal mitigation strategies, or cost-effective adaptations of existing technologies such as PICA, RCC, ablative composites, or non-traditional materials.  - Demonstrate feasibility through modeling, material testing, or small-scale prototyping that shows survivability in high-heat flux environments typical of atmospheric reentry.  - Compare thermal performance against manufacturing and lifecycle cost considerations to support decision-making around affordability and scalability.  - Outline a pathway to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) by identifying manufacturing routes, potential supply chain constraints, and design-for-manufacture considerations.   Deliverables may include:  - A concept feasibility report with supporting thermal and cost analysis  - Identification of candidate materials or designs for development  - Initial manufacturability assessment and LRIP transition strategy  - Recommendations for Phase II prototyping and validation testing   PHASE II: The Phase II effort will focus on advancing the research and the development effort initiated in Phase I. The Phase II project aims at maturing the design and/or concept from the Phase I-like effort and possibly a prototype to conduct research and testing in lab and realistic environments to provide essential data to address any technical challenges, safety concerns, regulatory requirements, and/or other concerns. Awardee(s) should also identify any challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP). The objective of Phase II is to mature and validate the low-cost thermal protection solution or internal thermal management concept developed in Phase I. This phase should focus on refining the design, fabricating a functional prototype, and conducting rigorous testing to evaluate performance in both laboratory and simulated reentry conditions. Key goals of Phase II include:   1. Engineering Development: Advance the design to a manufacturable and scalable prototype, incorporating insights from Phase I analysis and material characterization.  2. Testing and Evaluation: Perform high-fidelity thermal, structural, and environmental testing—such as arc-jet, plasma torch, or suborbital trajectory simulations—to validate thermal protection capabilities.  3. Integration Considerations: Evaluate the solution’s compatibility with atmospheric reentry containers and payload systems, including form factor, mass efficiency, and mounting techniques.  4. Cost and Production Analysis: Refine cost models, assess material sourcing and manufacturing techniques, and identify challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP).  5. Risk Assessment: Address technical, safety, and regulatory considerations for transition to operational deployment.   Deliverables could include:  - A validated prototype of the TPS or thermal management system.  - Test reports detailing thermal performance, survivability, and compliance with mission requirements.  - A production readiness assessment, including updated cost analysis and supply chain risks.  - A Phase III transition plan outlining commercialization paths and integration into space materiel transport missions.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort aims to demonstrate the thermal protection solution in an operational-like environment and achieve technology maturation and commercialization. The Phase III effort aims to transition the thermal protection solution (TPS) into operational use through demonstration in relevant or operational-like environments, including suborbital or orbital reentry test flights. The primary goal is to achieve technology maturation, certification readiness, and commercial scalability. Military applications:   - Rocket Cargo materiel transport: Enable rapid, survivable transport of materiel through atmospheric reentry for Space Force and Air Force missions.  - Responsive Launch & Recovery Systems: Support reusable or single-use TPS for cargo return vehicles, drop pods, or reentry platforms.   Commercial Applications:  - Reusable Space materiel transport: Enable lower-cost thermal shielding for commercial reentry capsules transporting cargo from low Earth orbit (LEO), lunar, or cislunar domains.  - Rocket Cargo materiel transport: Advance solutions for materiel transport and express cargo sectors interested in rapid global delivery via suborbital reentry platforms.  - Space Tourism and In-Space Manufacturing: Provide cost-effective thermal solutions for non-crew critical missions in emerging space economy applications.   Transition Goals:  - Conduct one or more operational flight demonstrations using integrated TPS solution.  - Finalize qualification data to support DoD or commercial certification standards.  - Develop manufacturing and sustainment plans to scale for production and fleet deployment.  - Establish commercial partnerships with space materiel transport providers, defense primes, or space capsule manufacturers for integration.   This effort supports the broader objectives of the Rocket Cargo portfolio and contributes to building a resilient industrial base for affordable, non-human-rated thermal protection technologies.

The current focus on expensive, high-performance materials like Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) and Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) is unsustainable for large-scale cargo transport. This topic calls for novel concepts—including new passive materials, active cooling systems, or cost-reduced versions of existing technologies—that ensure payload survivability for 1 to 10 metric ton class containers. The emphasis is on affordability, manufacturability, scalability, and repeatability.

          "Topic Title": "Affordable Thermal Protection Solution (ARMREST)",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Space Technology   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to investigate novel innovative concepts of low-cost expendable exterior Thermal Protection Solutions or internal thermal management solutions for atmospheric reentry containers. The concepts should focus on low-cost solutions whether it be developing a new passive solution (or material) or taking existing products (like Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC)) and lowering the cost. The proposed concepts can include either passive systems, active cooling, or non-traditional options.   The intent is to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solutions (TPS) or internal thermal management concepts for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. The focus is on identifying and characterizing materials, configurations, or cooling methods—either novel or modified from existing systems (e.g., PICA, RCC)—that provide adequate thermal protection at significantly reduced cost. Phase I aims to validate the thermal performance-to-cost trade space through modeling, small-scale testing, or analytical studies. Proposed solutions should emphasize manufacturability, scalability, and suitability for protecting payloads in the 1–10 metric ton class. Passive, active, or hybrid approaches are welcome, provided they show a clear path to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and system integration potential in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions by enabling the ability to operate after atmospheric reentry. A key objective of this effort is to help advance and reshape the commercial external thermal protection solution and/or internal thermal management solution industrial base(s) from one focused on high performance and expensive thermal protection solutions that deliver small mass to one focused on good performance and lower costs that still enables survivability of the payload in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. This might require novel new approaches to the design, fabrication, and/or testing of the external thermal protection solution or multiple Thermal Protection Solutions. The DAF is seeking to avoid the cost and inflexibility created by developing specialty solutions for this regime. External protections can be expendable as long as the contents inside the containers survive.   The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is pursuing new opportunities for Rocket Cargo materiel transport that require payload survivability following atmospheric reentry—without the cost or complexity of human-rated Thermal Protection Systems (TPS). Current TPS technologies are often over-engineered and cost-prohibitive for cargo-class missions, particularly in the 1 to 10 metric ton payload range. This topic seeks innovative, low-cost, expendable external TPS or internal thermal management solutions for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. Solutions may include new passive materials, active cooling systems, or modified commercial off-the-shelf technologies such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) adapted for affordability.  The objective is to reshape the industrial base from one centered on exquisite performance to one optimized for cost-effective survivability of critical payloads. Proposed approaches should emphasize manufacturability, repeatability, and integration potential for materiel transport missions. Expendability is acceptable so long as the payload remains intact and functional post-reentry. Novel design, fabrication, and testing strategies are encouraged, especially those that reduce thermal protection cost without compromising safety or performance in realistic reentry environments.   PHASE I: This Phase I effort will demonstrate a concept for a low-cost Thermal Protection Solution idea or conduct a feasibility study that is capable of showing the thermal protection properties in relation to the cost. Awardee(s) should also identify a viable route to manufacture or fabricate their proposed solution and/or identify challenges to get to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) processes in Phase II. The objective of Phase I is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solution (TPS) or internal thermal management system designed for atmospheric reentry of space cargo containers. The focus should be on proving the thermal performance of the concept relative to its cost, particularly for non-human rated, 1–10 metric ton payloads used in Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. Offerors should:   - Explore novel materials, passive or active thermal mitigation strategies, or cost-effective adaptations of existing technologies such as PICA, RCC, ablative composites, or non-traditional materials.  - Demonstrate feasibility through modeling, material testing, or small-scale prototyping that shows survivability in high-heat flux environments typical of atmospheric reentry.  - Compare thermal performance against manufacturing and lifecycle cost considerations to support decision-making around affordability and scalability.  - Outline a pathway to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) by identifying manufacturing routes, potential supply chain constraints, and design-for-manufacture considerations.   Deliverables may include:  - A concept feasibility report with supporting thermal and cost analysis  - Identification of candidate materials or designs for development  - Initial manufacturability assessment and LRIP transition strategy  - Recommendations for Phase II prototyping and validation testing   PHASE II: The Phase II effort will focus on advancing the research and the development effort initiated in Phase I. The Phase II project aims at maturing the design and/or concept from the Phase I-like effort and possibly a prototype to conduct research and testing in lab and realistic environments to provide essential data to address any technical challenges, safety concerns, regulatory requirements, and/or other concerns. Awardee(s) should also identify any challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP). The objective of Phase II is to mature and validate the low-cost thermal protection solution or internal thermal management concept developed in Phase I. This phase should focus on refining the design, fabricating a functional prototype, and conducting rigorous testing to evaluate performance in both laboratory and simulated reentry conditions. Key goals of Phase II include:   1. Engineering Development: Advance the design to a manufacturable and scalable prototype, incorporating insights from Phase I analysis and material characterization.  2. Testing and Evaluation: Perform high-fidelity thermal, structural, and environmental testing—such as arc-jet, plasma torch, or suborbital trajectory simulations—to validate thermal protection capabilities.  3. Integration Considerations: Evaluate the solution’s compatibility with atmospheric reentry containers and payload systems, including form factor, mass efficiency, and mounting techniques.  4. Cost and Production Analysis: Refine cost models, assess material sourcing and manufacturing techniques, and identify challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP).  5. Risk Assessment: Address technical, safety, and regulatory considerations for transition to operational deployment.   Deliverables could include:  - A validated prototype of the TPS or thermal management system.  - Test reports detailing thermal performance, survivability, and compliance with mission requirements.  - A production readiness assessment, including updated cost analysis and supply chain risks.  - A Phase III transition plan outlining commercialization paths and integration into space materiel transport missions.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort aims to demonstrate the thermal protection solution in an operational-like environment and achieve technology maturation and commercialization. The Phase III effort aims to transition the thermal protection solution (TPS) into operational use through demonstration in relevant or operational-like environments, including suborbital or orbital reentry test flights. The primary goal is to achieve technology maturation, certification readiness, and commercial scalability. Military applications:   - Rocket Cargo materiel transport: Enable rapid, survivable transport of materiel through atmospheric reentry for Space Force and Air Force missions.  - Responsive Launch & Recovery Systems: Support reusable or single-use TPS for cargo return vehicles, drop pods, or reentry platforms.   Commercial Applications:  - Reusable Space materiel transport: Enable lower-cost thermal shielding for commercial reentry capsules transporting cargo from low Earth orbit (LEO), lunar, or cislunar domains.  - Rocket Cargo materiel transport: Advance solutions for materiel transport and express cargo sectors interested in rapid global delivery via suborbital reentry platforms.  - Space Tourism and In-Space Manufacturing: Provide cost-effective thermal solutions for non-crew critical missions in emerging space economy applications.   Transition Goals:  - Conduct one or more operational flight demonstrations using integrated TPS solution.  - Finalize qualification data to support DoD or commercial certification standards.  - Develop manufacturing and sustainment plans to scale for production and fleet deployment.  - Establish commercial partnerships with space materiel transport providers, defense primes, or space capsule manufacturers for integration.   This effort supports the broader objectives of the Rocket Cargo portfolio and contributes to building a resilient industrial base for affordable, non-human-rated thermal protection technologies.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to investigate novel innovative concepts of low-cost expendable exterior Thermal Protection Solutions or internal thermal management solutions for atmospheric reentry containers. The concepts should focus on low-cost solutions whether it be developing a new passive solution (or material) or taking existing products (like Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC)) and lowering the cost. The proposed concepts can include either passive systems, active cooling, or non-traditional options.   The intent is to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solutions (TPS) or internal thermal management concepts for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. The focus is on identifying and characterizing materials, configurations, or cooling methods—either novel or modified from existing systems (e.g., PICA, RCC)—that provide adequate thermal protection at significantly reduced cost. Phase I aims to validate the thermal performance-to-cost trade space through modeling, small-scale testing, or analytical studies. Proposed solutions should emphasize manufacturability, scalability, and suitability for protecting payloads in the 1–10 metric ton class. Passive, active, or hybrid approaches are welcome, provided they show a clear path to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and system integration potential in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions by enabling the ability to operate after atmospheric reentry. A key objective of this effort is to help advance and reshape the commercial external thermal protection solution and/or internal thermal management solution industrial base(s) from one focused on high performance and expensive thermal protection solutions that deliver small mass to one focused on good performance and lower costs that still enables survivability of the payload in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. This might require novel new approaches to the design, fabrication, and/or testing of the external thermal protection solution or multiple Thermal Protection Solutions. The DAF is seeking to avoid the cost and inflexibility created by developing specialty solutions for this regime. External protections can be expendable as long as the contents inside the containers survive.   The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is pursuing new opportunities for Rocket Cargo materiel transport that require payload survivability following atmospheric reentry—without the cost or complexity of human-rated Thermal Protection Systems (TPS). Current TPS technologies are often over-engineered and cost-prohibitive for cargo-class missions, particularly in the 1 to 10 metric ton payload range. This topic seeks innovative, low-cost, expendable external TPS or internal thermal management solutions for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. Solutions may include new passive materials, active cooling systems, or modified commercial off-the-shelf technologies such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) adapted for affordability.  The objective is to reshape the industrial base from one centered on exquisite performance to one optimized for cost-effective survivability of critical payloads. Proposed approaches should emphasize manufacturability, repeatability, and integration potential for materiel transport missions. Expendability is acceptable so long as the payload remains intact and functional post-reentry. Novel design, fabrication, and testing strategies are encouraged, especially those that reduce thermal protection cost without compromising safety or performance in realistic reentry environments.   PHASE I: This Phase I effort will demonstrate a concept for a low-cost Thermal Protection Solution idea or conduct a feasibility study that is capable of showing the thermal protection properties in relation to the cost. Awardee(s) should also identify a viable route to manufacture or fabricate their proposed solution and/or identify challenges to get to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) processes in Phase II. The objective of Phase I is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solution (TPS) or internal thermal management system designed for atmospheric reentry of space cargo containers. The focus should be on proving the thermal performance of the concept relative to its cost, particularly for non-human rated, 1–10 metric ton payloads used in Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. Offerors should:   - Explore novel materials, passive or active thermal mitigation strategies, or cost-effective adaptations of existing technologies such as PICA, RCC, ablative composites, or non-traditional materials.  - Demonstrate feasibility through modeling, material testing, or small-scale prototyping that shows survivability in high-heat flux environments typical of atmospheric reentry.  - Compare thermal performance against manufacturing and lifecycle cost considerations to support decision-making around affordability and scalability.  - Outline a pathway to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) by identifying manufacturing routes, potential supply chain constraints, and design-for-manufacture considerations.   Deliverables may include:  - A concept feasibility report with supporting thermal and cost analysis  - Identification of candidate materials or designs for development  - Initial manufacturability assessment and LRIP transition strategy  - Recommendations for Phase II prototyping and validation testing   PHASE II: The Phase II effort will focus on advancing the research and the development effort initiated in Phase I. The Phase II project aims at maturing the design and/or concept from the Phase I-like effort and possibly a prototype to conduct research and testing in lab and realistic environments to provide essential data to address any technical challenges, safety concerns, regulatory requirements, and/or other concerns. Awardee(s) should also identify any challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP). The objective of Phase II is to mature and validate the low-cost thermal protection solution or internal thermal management concept developed in Phase I. This phase should focus on refining the design, fabricating a functional prototype, and conducting rigorous testing to evaluate performance in both laboratory and simulated reentry conditions. Key goals of Phase II include:   1. Engineering Development: Advance the design to a manufacturable and scalable prototype, incorporating insights from Phase I analysis and material characterization.  2. Testing and Evaluation: Perform high-fidelity thermal, structural, and environmental testing—such as arc-jet, plasma torch, or suborbital trajectory simulations—to validate thermal protection capabilities.  3. Integration Considerations: Evaluate the solution’s compatibility with atmospheric reentry containers and payload systems, including form factor, mass efficiency, and mounting techniques.  4. Cost and Production Analysis: Refine cost models, assess material sourcing and manufacturing techniques, and identify challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP).  5. Risk Assessment: Address technical, safety, and regulatory considerations for transition to operational deployment.   Deliverables could include:  - A validated prototype of the TPS or thermal management system.  - Test reports detailing thermal performance, survivability, and compliance with mission requirements.  - A production readiness assessment, including updated cost analysis and supply chain risks.  - A Phase III transition plan outlining commercialization paths and integration into space materiel transport missions.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort aims to demonstrate the thermal protection solution in an operational-like environment and achieve technology maturation and commercialization. The Phase III effort aims to transition the thermal protection solution (TPS) into operational use through demonstration in relevant or operational-like environments, including suborbital or orbital reentry test flights. The primary goal is to achieve technology maturation, certification readiness, and commercial scalability. Military applications:   - Rocket Cargo materiel transport: Enable rapid, survivable transport of materiel through atmospheric reentry for Space Force and Air Force missions.  - Responsive Launch & Recovery Systems: Support reusable or single-use TPS for cargo return vehicles, drop pods, or reentry platforms.   Commercial Applications:  - Reusable Space materiel transport: Enable lower-cost thermal shielding for commercial reentry capsules transporting cargo from low Earth orbit (LEO), lunar, or cislunar domains.  - Rocket Cargo materiel transport: Advance solutions for materiel transport and express cargo sectors interested in rapid global delivery via suborbital reentry platforms.  - Space Tourism and In-Space Manufacturing: Provide cost-effective thermal solutions for non-crew critical missions in emerging space economy applications.   Transition Goals:  - Conduct one or more operational flight demonstrations using integrated TPS solution.  - Finalize qualification data to support DoD or commercial certification standards.  - Develop manufacturing and sustainment plans to scale for production and fleet deployment.  - Establish commercial partnerships with space materiel transport providers, defense primes, or space capsule manufacturers for integration.   This effort supports the broader objectives of the Rocket Cargo portfolio and contributes to building a resilient industrial base for affordable, non-human-rated thermal protection technologies.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to develop an Autonomous Space Cargo Network (ASCN) that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven automation, autonomous robotics, and digital twin technology to modernize and optimize cargo handling and logistics operations at the Space Joint Movement Complex (SJMC) and across the Department of Defense’s (DoD) space mobility enterprise. The ASCN will improve operational efficiency, accuracy, and resilience by enabling real-time cargo visibility, autonomous load planning, and adaptive logistics execution. This capability will form the foundation for a scalable, cybersecure, and interoperable logistics framework supporting space sustainment missions in both contested and commercial environments.   DESCRIPTION: The SJMC is envisioned as the central logistics hub for DoD space operations, supporting rapid deployment, sustainment, and agile mobility. Current cargo handling and logistics processes are heavily manual, lack real-time adaptability, and are not optimized for space-based supply chains or contested logistics environments. To address these gaps, the ASCN will deliver an integrated, AI-driven logistics automation platform designed to support the SJMC and broader DoD logistics operations. The ASCN will combine autonomous robotics, intelligent decision-support, and digital twin technology to enable full-spectrum cargo management—from warehouse to orbital interface—while increasing speed, precision, and resilience. Key capabilities include:   1. Autonomous Cargo Handling & Transport Optimization – This includes robotic forklifts and cargo handlers for autonomous loading/unloading, AI-based routing, prioritization, and adaptive logistics workflows, and seamless integration with space, air, and ground mobility operations.   2. AI-Driven Logistics Command & Control – This includes real-time AI controller for cargo flow, load planning, and schedule optimization, weight-based load verification and automated resupply workflows, integration with the Spaceport of the Future’s Common Operating Picture (SPOF COP).   3. Machine Learning for Mission Adaptability – This includes predictive analytics for storage allocation and resource positioning, dynamic mission reprioritization and automated contingency planning, and visibility and orchestration across all classes of supply.   4. Commercial & Military Logistics Interoperability – This includes compatibility with U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Space Systems Command (SSC), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and commercial launch providers, joint DoD-commercial protocol development for space cargo integration, and enhanced operational readiness across government and industry supply chains.      5. Cybersecure & Resilient AI Robotics Architecture – This includes blockchain-secured logistics tracking and tamper prevention, quantum-resistant AI algorithms for autonomy assurance, and Zero Trust cybersecurity framework for secure operations at all classification levels.   This effort will lay the foundation for a future-ready, modular, and scalable space logistics infrastructure, aligned with U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment strategy and capable of supporting both terrestrial and extraterrestrial cargo networks.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to develop a conceptual design and functional prototype for the ASCN—a system that integrates AI-enabled robotics, cargo handling automation, and logistics optimization for space-focused environments. The effort will evaluate the feasibility of supporting standard DoD platforms, such as fully loaded 463L pallets, and determine the scalability of the solution for future autonomous cargo transport at the SJMC. Technical approach consideration include:   - Simulate AI-enhanced cargo workflows within the SJMC, focusing on load planning, routing, and weight distribution using real-time sensing technologies.  - Design and model robotic automation frameworks for autonomous cargo handling, scheduling, and dynamic load stabilization.  - Assess integration with existing DoD logistics platforms and commercial space operations, including compatibility with USTRANSCOM, DLA, SSC, and commercial launch provider networks.  - Conduct stakeholder engagements with logistics planners and operational units to refine system requirements.  - Execute preliminary load balance and maneuverability testing using 463L pallets to identify mechanical design needs.  - Perform energy efficiency and power requirement analyses to inform autonomous runtime and charging strategies.

PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate a fully operational prototype of the ASCN capable of autonomous cargo handling, intelligent logistics coordination, and mission adaptability in contested or austere logistics environments. This phase will validate the system’s ability to improve cargo throughput, reduce human intervention, and integrate with both DoD and commercial logistics systems. Technical focus areas include:   - Build and integrate a full-scale ASCN prototype with autonomous robotic handlers, real-time cargo identification, and secure communications.  - Implement advanced AI models for adaptive cargo prioritization, dynamic routing, and autonomous load planning.  - Integrate with existing DoD logistics platforms such as USTRANSCOM, the Spaceport of the Future’s COP Logistics Module, and commercial systems where applicable.  - Conduct operational testing in representative logistics environments (e.g., Space Launch facilities, Distribution Hubs).  - Collect performance data for load accuracy, handling speed, mission responsiveness, energy usage, and system reliability.  - Demonstrate predictive maintenance and mission adaptability functions under simulated disruption scenarios.   Phase II deliverables include:  - Fully functional ASCN prototype, including AI, autonomy, and system integration components.  - Operational test campaign report, capturing performance metrics, environmental tolerance, and logistics throughput improvements.  - AI performance evaluation, including model training, learning adaptability, and logistics decision support outputs.  - Integration documentation detailing system compatibility with SSC, DLA, USTRANSCOM, and commercial logistics platforms.  - Phase III transition plan, outlining commercialization strategy, scaling pathways, and targeted end-user adoption timelines.

This capability will form the foundation for a scalable, cybersecure, and interoperable logistics framework supporting space sustainment missions in both contested and commercial environments.   DESCRIPTION: The SJMC is envisioned as the central logistics hub for DoD space operations, supporting rapid deployment, sustainment, and agile mobility. Current cargo handling and logistics processes are heavily manual, lack real-time adaptability, and are not optimized for space-based supply chains or contested logistics environments. To address these gaps, the ASCN will deliver an integrated, AI-driven logistics automation platform designed to support the SJMC and broader DoD logistics operations. The ASCN will combine autonomous robotics, intelligent decision-support, and digital twin technology to enable full-spectrum cargo management—from warehouse to orbital interface—while increasing speed, precision, and resilience. Key capabilities include:   1. Autonomous Cargo Handling & Transport Optimization – This includes robotic forklifts and cargo handlers for autonomous loading/unloading, AI-based routing, prioritization, and adaptive logistics workflows, and seamless integration with space, air, and ground mobility operations.   2. AI-Driven Logistics Command & Control – This includes real-time AI controller for cargo flow, load planning, and schedule optimization, weight-based load verification and automated resupply workflows, integration with the Spaceport of the Future’s Common Operating Picture (SPOF COP).   3. Machine Learning for Mission Adaptability – This includes predictive analytics for storage allocation and resource positioning, dynamic mission reprioritization and automated contingency planning, and visibility and orchestration across all classes of supply.   4. Commercial & Military Logistics Interoperability – This includes compatibility with U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Space Systems Command (SSC), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and commercial launch providers, joint DoD-commercial protocol development for space cargo integration, and enhanced operational readiness across government and industry supply chains.      5. Cybersecure & Resilient AI Robotics Architecture – This includes blockchain-secured logistics tracking and tamper prevention, quantum-resistant AI algorithms for autonomy assurance, and Zero Trust cybersecurity framework for secure operations at all classification levels.   This effort will lay the foundation for a future-ready, modular, and scalable space logistics infrastructure, aligned with U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment strategy and capable of supporting both terrestrial and extraterrestrial cargo networks.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to develop a conceptual design and functional prototype for the ASCN—a system that integrates AI-enabled robotics, cargo handling automation, and logistics optimization for space-focused environments. The effort will evaluate the feasibility of supporting standard DoD platforms, such as fully loaded 463L pallets, and determine the scalability of the solution for future autonomous cargo transport at the SJMC. Technical approach consideration include:   - Simulate AI-enhanced cargo workflows within the SJMC, focusing on load planning, routing, and weight distribution using real-time sensing technologies.  - Design and model robotic automation frameworks for autonomous cargo handling, scheduling, and dynamic load stabilization.  - Assess integration with existing DoD logistics platforms and commercial space operations, including compatibility with USTRANSCOM, DLA, SSC, and commercial launch provider networks.  - Conduct stakeholder engagements with logistics planners and operational units to refine system requirements.  - Execute preliminary load balance and maneuverability testing using 463L pallets to identify mechanical design needs.  - Perform energy efficiency and power requirement analyses to inform autonomous runtime and charging strategies.

The system must automatically determine time, location, and vector data, and provide impact predictions for Earth-bound objects. The solution should integrate with existing Space Domain Awareness (SDA) toolchains and support automated alerting, data dissemination via public application interface (APIs), and contribution to the Unified Data Library (UDL).   DESCRIPTION: As space operations evolve and adversaries adopt non-traditional propulsion methods and exotic orbital behaviors, the need for enhanced SDA is increasingly critical. Emerging threats—including hypersonic glide vehicles, suborbital missiles, and high-altitude platforms such as surveillance balloons—pose a significant challenge to current detection and command-and-control systems. To address this capability gap, U.S. Space Force (USSF) Space Systems Command (SSC) SDA Tools, Applications, and Processing (TAP) Lab is seeking hardware and/or software-based solutions that can automatically and in real time detect, track, and predict the trajectory of objects transiting the upper atmosphere (200–400 km altitude) at space-capable velocities—defined as speeds above traditional aircraft but below orbital velocity. The proposed solution must:   - Detect time, location, and vector of objects in near real-time.   - Predict impact point and time for Earth-bound trajectories.   - Leverage data driven solutions such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) (other state of the art) that are capable of processing data at high rates (edge computing).   - Seamlessly integrate into SDA Tap Lab and USSF toolchains via secure APIs.   - Be capable of publishing data to the UDL and optionally via a public-facing API for broader operational use.   This request includes six key technical subtasks:   1. Ingest and process data from ionospheric, geomagnetic, or similar sensor sources.   2. Detect atmospheric disturbances indicative of object ingress/egress.   3. Localize events within the 200–400 km altitude range.   4. Correlate multiple detections into a single transiting object event.   5. Generate object tracks, including time, position, and velocity vector.   6. Predict the final location and time of impact.   Potential data sources may include:   - Ionospheric sensors (e.g., Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)),   - Geomagnetic sensors (e.g., United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geomagnetism Program),   - Web-accessible Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms.   Innovative techniques such as ionospheric anomaly analysis, Global Positioning System (GPS) signal interference, and localized telemetry disruption are encouraged. Outputs should be operator-meaningful and enhance unclassified tipping and queuing workflows. The solution must meet all development, operational, and cybersecurity requirements necessary for deployment on classified systems.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the USAF and/or USSF need(s).   2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.   3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The goal of the Phase II effort is to develop and deploy a real-time hardware and/or software capability that can detect, track, and predict the path of high-velocity objects transiting through the upper atmosphere (200–400 km altitude) at space-capable velocities. The solution must identify the time, location, and vector of these objects, and—if Earth-bound—predict impact time and location. This will include but is not limited to data-driven approaches capable of handling large data volumes, real-time data ingestion, and efficiency in data processing time. This capability will enhance USSF’s SDA by addressing existing sensor and detection gaps associated with non-traditional propulsion methods and exotic orbits. Key objectives include:   - Improve and operationalize a prototype developed in the Phase I-type feasibility study.   - Refine detection algorithms using ionospheric, geomagnetic, and SDR-based data inputs.   - Expand the system’s ability to associate and localize multiple disturbances into a single object event.   - Enhance model evaluation metrics, such as detection accuracy, latency, and false alarm rate.   - Integrate predictive modeling to estimate Earth-bound object impact locations and time windows.   - Collaborate with SSC SDA TAP Lab to ensure solution usability and mission alignment.   Expected Deliverables May Include:   - A deployable hardware and/or software prototype capable of processing real-time sensor data from sources such as SuperDARN, USGS, and web-accessible SDRs.   - Detecting and tracking objects traveling at suborbital (“space-capable”) speeds.   - Generating a complete track: time, location, and velocity vector.   - Predicting the Earth impact point for relevant objects.   - A validated integration API compatible with existing SDA toolchains.   - Data publishing capability to the UDL.   - Operator-focused interface or output format to support unclassified tipping and queuing.   - System documentation including architecture and design, integration instructions, and cybersecurity compliance package for classified system use.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort will focus on scaling and operationalizing the software system developed in Phase II to support the comprehensive analysis of all launch and high-velocity atmospheric events, not limited to suborbital or “space-capable” transits. The system will be enhanced to provide automated, real-time alerts and impact predictions, improving strategic responsiveness, and overall space domain awareness for U.S. military operations. This may involve the development of advanced notification systems capable of disseminating critical information to relevant stakeholders in real-time or near-real-time and facilitate prompt decision-making and responsiveness. The final solution should not involve heuristic methodology but should be founded on data-driven decisions using large volumes of data in real-time. Key Phase III efforts may include:   - Integration of broader data sources and advanced analytics to improve detection reliability and precision.   - Deployment of real-time notification systems capable of distributing alerts to relevant stakeholders for faster decision-making and response.   - Optimization for operational environments, including cybersecurity, scalability, and classified system deployment.   This capability directly supports national security objectives by enabling early warning, characterization, and attribution of unconventional space or atmospheric activities. The core technology developed through this effort has strong dual-use applicability:   - Commercial satellite operators can leverage the system to monitor threats to on-orbit assets from suborbital events or debris.   - Spaceport operators can use it for enhanced launch safety and atmospheric situational awareness.   - Civil agencies (e.g., National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)) may integrate the tool into broader space traffic management and launch event tracking frameworks.   - Academic and research institutions may use the system to study upper atmospheric dynamics or support scientific missions.   By offering a modular, API-accessible, and extensible platform, the solution can serve both defense and commercial markets, maximizing its operational utility and economic impact.   REFERENCES:   1.

          "Topic Title": "Real-Time Detection and Tracking of High-Velocity Atmospheric Transits",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Emerging Threat Reduction   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to develop a real-time hardware and/or software tool capable of detecting, tracking, and predicting the trajectory of high-speed objects transiting the upper atmosphere (200–400 km altitude) at suborbital or “space-capable” velocities. The system must automatically determine time, location, and vector data, and provide impact predictions for Earth-bound objects. The solution should integrate with existing Space Domain Awareness (SDA) toolchains and support automated alerting, data dissemination via public application interface (APIs), and contribution to the Unified Data Library (UDL).   DESCRIPTION: As space operations evolve and adversaries adopt non-traditional propulsion methods and exotic orbital behaviors, the need for enhanced SDA is increasingly critical. Emerging threats—including hypersonic glide vehicles, suborbital missiles, and high-altitude platforms such as surveillance balloons—pose a significant challenge to current detection and command-and-control systems. To address this capability gap, U.S. Space Force (USSF) Space Systems Command (SSC) SDA Tools, Applications, and Processing (TAP) Lab is seeking hardware and/or software-based solutions that can automatically and in real time detect, track, and predict the trajectory of objects transiting the upper atmosphere (200–400 km altitude) at space-capable velocities—defined as speeds above traditional aircraft but below orbital velocity. The proposed solution must:   - Detect time, location, and vector of objects in near real-time.   - Predict impact point and time for Earth-bound trajectories.   - Leverage data driven solutions such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) (other state of the art) that are capable of processing data at high rates (edge computing).   - Seamlessly integrate into SDA Tap Lab and USSF toolchains via secure APIs.   - Be capable of publishing data to the UDL and optionally via a public-facing API for broader operational use.   This request includes six key technical subtasks:   1. Ingest and process data from ionospheric, geomagnetic, or similar sensor sources.   2. Detect atmospheric disturbances indicative of object ingress/egress.   3. Localize events within the 200–400 km altitude range.   4. Correlate multiple detections into a single transiting object event.   5. Generate object tracks, including time, position, and velocity vector.   6. Predict the final location and time of impact.   Potential data sources may include:   - Ionospheric sensors (e.g., Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)),   - Geomagnetic sensors (e.g., United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geomagnetism Program),   - Web-accessible Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms.   Innovative techniques such as ionospheric anomaly analysis, Global Positioning System (GPS) signal interference, and localized telemetry disruption are encouraged. Outputs should be operator-meaningful and enhance unclassified tipping and queuing workflows. The solution must meet all development, operational, and cybersecurity requirements necessary for deployment on classified systems.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the USAF and/or USSF need(s).   2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.   3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The goal of the Phase II effort is to develop and deploy a real-time hardware and/or software capability that can detect, track, and predict the path of high-velocity objects transiting through the upper atmosphere (200–400 km altitude) at space-capable velocities. The solution must identify the time, location, and vector of these objects, and—if Earth-bound—predict impact time and location. This will include but is not limited to data-driven approaches capable of handling large data volumes, real-time data ingestion, and efficiency in data processing time. This capability will enhance USSF’s SDA by addressing existing sensor and detection gaps associated with non-traditional propulsion methods and exotic orbits. Key objectives include:   - Improve and operationalize a prototype developed in the Phase I-type feasibility study.   - Refine detection algorithms using ionospheric, geomagnetic, and SDR-based data inputs.   - Expand the system’s ability to associate and localize multiple disturbances into a single object event.   - Enhance model evaluation metrics, such as detection accuracy, latency, and false alarm rate.   - Integrate predictive modeling to estimate Earth-bound object impact locations and time windows.   - Collaborate with SSC SDA TAP Lab to ensure solution usability and mission alignment.   Expected Deliverables May Include:   - A deployable hardware and/or software prototype capable of processing real-time sensor data from sources such as SuperDARN, USGS, and web-accessible SDRs.   - Detecting and tracking objects traveling at suborbital (“space-capable”) speeds.   - Generating a complete track: time, location, and velocity vector.   - Predicting the Earth impact point for relevant objects.   - A validated integration API compatible with existing SDA toolchains.   - Data publishing capability to the UDL.   - Operator-focused interface or output format to support unclassified tipping and queuing.   - System documentation including architecture and design, integration instructions, and cybersecurity compliance package for classified system use.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort will focus on scaling and operationalizing the software system developed in Phase II to support the comprehensive analysis of all launch and high-velocity atmospheric events, not limited to suborbital or “space-capable” transits. The system will be enhanced to provide automated, real-time alerts and impact predictions, improving strategic responsiveness, and overall space domain awareness for U.S. military operations. This may involve the development of advanced notification systems capable of disseminating critical information to relevant stakeholders in real-time or near-real-time and facilitate prompt decision-making and responsiveness. The final solution should not involve heuristic methodology but should be founded on data-driven decisions using large volumes of data in real-time. Key Phase III efforts may include:   - Integration of broader data sources and advanced analytics to improve detection reliability and precision.   - Deployment of real-time notification systems capable of distributing alerts to relevant stakeholders for faster decision-making and response.   - Optimization for operational environments, including cybersecurity, scalability, and classified system deployment.   This capability directly supports national security objectives by enabling early warning, characterization, and attribution of unconventional space or atmospheric activities. The core technology developed through this effort has strong dual-use applicability:   - Commercial satellite operators can leverage the system to monitor threats to on-orbit assets from suborbital events or debris.   - Spaceport operators can use it for enhanced launch safety and atmospheric situational awareness.   - Civil agencies (e.g., National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)) may integrate the tool into broader space traffic management and launch event tracking frameworks.   - Academic and research institutions may use the system to study upper atmospheric dynamics or support scientific missions.   By offering a modular, API-accessible, and extensible platform, the solution can serve both defense and commercial markets, maximizing its operational utility and economic impact.   REFERENCES:   1.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled software tool to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment planning of U.S Department of Defense (DoD) cargo across a variety of container types. The solution must enhance agility, reduce packing time, and integrate maintenance and load planning actions while functioning in contested, disconnected, or coalition environments. It should support activity tracking, intelligent inventory mapping, and dynamic, on-the-fly reconfiguration based on real-time operational inputs. The system should allow user-friendly interaction through advanced Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), offer edge compute capabilities, and be adaptable to different user needs, cargo types, and mission constraints. The end goal is a scalable, dual-use tool that enhances mission readiness while also offering commercial logistics value.   DESCRIPTION: Space Logistics cargo operations—such as those involving Readiness Spares Packages (RSPs)—are vital to enabling the U.S. Space Force (USSF) to respond quickly to crises, contingencies, or emerging mission requirements. These operations rely on containerized systems (e.g., ISU-90s, 463L pallets, and custom bins or boxes) to preposition equipment, spares, and supplies. However, the current process for preparing and packing these systems is time-consuming, largely manual, and prone to errors, which limits readiness and agility. The USSF is seeking an innovative AI-enabled solution to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment of cargo containers for movement to forward locations or spaceports. The desired tool should:   - Significantly reduce packing time and errors;  - Optimize spatial usage, weight distribution, and container selection;  - Provide real-time visibility into packing activity and container contents; and  - Integrate maintenance and load planning considerations into the cargo configuration process.   The system should ingest standard logistics data, such as National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and UTC (Unit Type Code) information from Major Command (MAJCOM) or Field Command (FLDCOM) sources, and output detailed container-level packing plans. It must support various container formats, be adaptable to different cargo profiles (including hazardous or classified items), and provide activity tracking and operational alerts to assist planners and personnel throughout the pack-out process. Solutions should prioritize user-centered design, enabling intuitive interaction through advanced HMI such as voice recognition, touch screens, or augment reality/virtual reality (AR/VR). The tool must be operable in contested or communications-degraded environments, offering edge-computing capabilities and the ability to sync with central systems when reconnected. This capability will directly enhance the USSF’s ability to execute rapid, distributed logistics operations with reduced cognitive burden on Airmen and Guardians. The topic is intended to stimulate innovative research and development (R&D) toward a dual-use solution with strong applicability in both defense and commercial logistics sectors   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Phase II goal is to develop and demonstrate a functional prototype system that addresses the USSF’s need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cargo packing and load planning for deployment and sustainment operations. The prototype should enable more rapid and accurate configuration of cargo across a range of container types and operational scenarios. It should support improved planning, activity tracking, and information flow in environments that may have limited communications or require flexibility for changing mission conditions. Phase II work is expected to include:   - Prototype Development: build a working software prototype that supports optimized planning and configuration of cargo. The system should accommodate various data inputs and packing constraints, including space, weight, timing, and priority of items.  - Operational Integration Context: demonstrate the prototype’s ability to support logistics personnel during cargo preparation and movement activities. This may include generating container-specific outputs, supporting real-time updates, or aligning with mission support functions such as maintenance scheduling or readiness tracking.  - Evaluation in Relevant Environment: develop a test plan and evaluate the prototype in an operationally representative setting. Capture performance metrics such as time reduction, accuracy of packing plans, user workload reduction, or adaptability to mission constraints.  - Transition Planning and Dual-Use Considerations: begin to define potential transition pathways, including DoD logistics operations and commercial applications. Consider compatibility with existing systems and outline next steps for operational deployment or commercial scaling.   Deliverables for Phase II may include:  - A functioning prototype software system;  - A technical report describing system capabilities, interfaces, and performance results;  - A summary of evaluation outcomes and user feedback;  - Documentation to support transition or further development;  - A commercialization and transition strategy aligned with potential military and commercial applications.   Phase II will deliver a validated prototype system that enables more efficient, informed, and agile cargo packing and planning. The solution should enhance operational readiness, reduce time and error in the packing process, and support integration with broader logistics and sustainment activities.   To facilitate the potential transition from Phase II to Phase III, a transition plan will be developed that outlines the steps necessary to ensure that the optimization solution is deployed and used effectively by government and commercial partners. The plan will include a timeline for deployment, a plan for identifying potential partners and customers, and a plan for marketing and selling the solution. The plan will also include a detailed description of the integration plan, and any necessary modifications or customizations needed to make the solution compatible with existing systems.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort for the RSP Optimization for Efficient Deployment SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization. The developed technology has dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. Military applications include RSP deployment and other supply chain management operations, as well as maintenance and load planning actions. The technology can help the military optimize its logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Commercial applications manufacturing, and distribution. The technology can help commercial organizations optimize their logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.   The expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, with a well-defined and validated software solution ready for commercialization. The technology will have been tested and validated in realistic environments, and any necessary modifications or customizations will have been made to ensure that it is compatible with existing systems and workflows. Additional information regarding transition planning includes identifying known government approvals required for deployment and any additional opportunities for deployment of the optimization solution within the government and commercial sectors. The integration plan will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure that the optimization solution is integrated seamlessly into their existing systems and workflows.   Overall, the expected Phase III effort for the ASTROPAC SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization, with dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. The expected TRL at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, and the transition planning will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure seamless integration into existing systems and workflows.

Project ASTROPAC aims to replace the slow, error-prone manual configuration of containers (e.g., ISU-90s) with an intelligent tool that optimizes for space, weight, item priority, and other complex constraints. The core challenge is to develop a system that not only provides optimal packing plans but also functions reliably in contested, communications-denied environments through edge computing and features advanced, intuitive Human-Machine Interfaces (AR/VR, voice) to reduce operator burden. This opportunity is for companies that have already demonstrated the feasibility of a relevant technology and secured a partnership with a USSF or USAF end-user. Key capabilities needed include deep expertise in AI/ML optimization algorithms, distributed software systems, UI/UX design, and a strong understanding of DoD logistics. The innovation lies in creating a resilient, dynamic, and user-centric logistics tool that directly enhances military readiness while also possessing significant dual-use potential for commercial sectors like manufacturing and distribution.

          "Topic Title": "Project ASTROPAC: Intelligent Cargo Configuration and Deployment Planning for Enhanced Readiness",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled software tool to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment planning of U.S Department of Defense (DoD) cargo across a variety of container types. The solution must enhance agility, reduce packing time, and integrate maintenance and load planning actions while functioning in contested, disconnected, or coalition environments. It should support activity tracking, intelligent inventory mapping, and dynamic, on-the-fly reconfiguration based on real-time operational inputs. The system should allow user-friendly interaction through advanced Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), offer edge compute capabilities, and be adaptable to different user needs, cargo types, and mission constraints. The end goal is a scalable, dual-use tool that enhances mission readiness while also offering commercial logistics value.   DESCRIPTION: Space Logistics cargo operations—such as those involving Readiness Spares Packages (RSPs)—are vital to enabling the U.S. Space Force (USSF) to respond quickly to crises, contingencies, or emerging mission requirements. These operations rely on containerized systems (e.g., ISU-90s, 463L pallets, and custom bins or boxes) to preposition equipment, spares, and supplies. However, the current process for preparing and packing these systems is time-consuming, largely manual, and prone to errors, which limits readiness and agility. The USSF is seeking an innovative AI-enabled solution to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment of cargo containers for movement to forward locations or spaceports. The desired tool should:   - Significantly reduce packing time and errors;  - Optimize spatial usage, weight distribution, and container selection;  - Provide real-time visibility into packing activity and container contents; and  - Integrate maintenance and load planning considerations into the cargo configuration process.   The system should ingest standard logistics data, such as National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and UTC (Unit Type Code) information from Major Command (MAJCOM) or Field Command (FLDCOM) sources, and output detailed container-level packing plans. It must support various container formats, be adaptable to different cargo profiles (including hazardous or classified items), and provide activity tracking and operational alerts to assist planners and personnel throughout the pack-out process. Solutions should prioritize user-centered design, enabling intuitive interaction through advanced HMI such as voice recognition, touch screens, or augment reality/virtual reality (AR/VR). The tool must be operable in contested or communications-degraded environments, offering edge-computing capabilities and the ability to sync with central systems when reconnected. This capability will directly enhance the USSF’s ability to execute rapid, distributed logistics operations with reduced cognitive burden on Airmen and Guardians. The topic is intended to stimulate innovative research and development (R&D) toward a dual-use solution with strong applicability in both defense and commercial logistics sectors   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Phase II goal is to develop and demonstrate a functional prototype system that addresses the USSF’s need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cargo packing and load planning for deployment and sustainment operations. The prototype should enable more rapid and accurate configuration of cargo across a range of container types and operational scenarios. It should support improved planning, activity tracking, and information flow in environments that may have limited communications or require flexibility for changing mission conditions. Phase II work is expected to include:   - Prototype Development: build a working software prototype that supports optimized planning and configuration of cargo. The system should accommodate various data inputs and packing constraints, including space, weight, timing, and priority of items.  - Operational Integration Context: demonstrate the prototype’s ability to support logistics personnel during cargo preparation and movement activities. This may include generating container-specific outputs, supporting real-time updates, or aligning with mission support functions such as maintenance scheduling or readiness tracking.  - Evaluation in Relevant Environment: develop a test plan and evaluate the prototype in an operationally representative setting. Capture performance metrics such as time reduction, accuracy of packing plans, user workload reduction, or adaptability to mission constraints.  - Transition Planning and Dual-Use Considerations: begin to define potential transition pathways, including DoD logistics operations and commercial applications. Consider compatibility with existing systems and outline next steps for operational deployment or commercial scaling.   Deliverables for Phase II may include:  - A functioning prototype software system;  - A technical report describing system capabilities, interfaces, and performance results;  - A summary of evaluation outcomes and user feedback;  - Documentation to support transition or further development;  - A commercialization and transition strategy aligned with potential military and commercial applications.   Phase II will deliver a validated prototype system that enables more efficient, informed, and agile cargo packing and planning. The solution should enhance operational readiness, reduce time and error in the packing process, and support integration with broader logistics and sustainment activities.   To facilitate the potential transition from Phase II to Phase III, a transition plan will be developed that outlines the steps necessary to ensure that the optimization solution is deployed and used effectively by government and commercial partners. The plan will include a timeline for deployment, a plan for identifying potential partners and customers, and a plan for marketing and selling the solution. The plan will also include a detailed description of the integration plan, and any necessary modifications or customizations needed to make the solution compatible with existing systems.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort for the RSP Optimization for Efficient Deployment SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization. The developed technology has dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. Military applications include RSP deployment and other supply chain management operations, as well as maintenance and load planning actions. The technology can help the military optimize its logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Commercial applications manufacturing, and distribution. The technology can help commercial organizations optimize their logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.   The expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, with a well-defined and validated software solution ready for commercialization. The technology will have been tested and validated in realistic environments, and any necessary modifications or customizations will have been made to ensure that it is compatible with existing systems and workflows. Additional information regarding transition planning includes identifying known government approvals required for deployment and any additional opportunities for deployment of the optimization solution within the government and commercial sectors. The integration plan will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure that the optimization solution is integrated seamlessly into their existing systems and workflows.   Overall, the expected Phase III effort for the ASTROPAC SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization, with dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. The expected TRL at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, and the transition planning will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure seamless integration into existing systems and workflows.

          "Topic Title": "Project ASTROPAC: Intelligent Cargo Configuration and Deployment Planning for Enhanced Readiness",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled software tool to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment planning of U.S Department of Defense (DoD) cargo across a variety of container types. The solution must enhance agility, reduce packing time, and integrate maintenance and load planning actions while functioning in contested, disconnected, or coalition environments. It should support activity tracking, intelligent inventory mapping, and dynamic, on-the-fly reconfiguration based on real-time operational inputs. The system should allow user-friendly interaction through advanced Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), offer edge compute capabilities, and be adaptable to different user needs, cargo types, and mission constraints. The end goal is a scalable, dual-use tool that enhances mission readiness while also offering commercial logistics value.   DESCRIPTION: Space Logistics cargo operations—such as those involving Readiness Spares Packages (RSPs)—are vital to enabling the U.S. Space Force (USSF) to respond quickly to crises, contingencies, or emerging mission requirements. These operations rely on containerized systems (e.g., ISU-90s, 463L pallets, and custom bins or boxes) to preposition equipment, spares, and supplies. However, the current process for preparing and packing these systems is time-consuming, largely manual, and prone to errors, which limits readiness and agility. The USSF is seeking an innovative AI-enabled solution to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment of cargo containers for movement to forward locations or spaceports. The desired tool should:   - Significantly reduce packing time and errors;  - Optimize spatial usage, weight distribution, and container selection;  - Provide real-time visibility into packing activity and container contents; and  - Integrate maintenance and load planning considerations into the cargo configuration process.   The system should ingest standard logistics data, such as National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and UTC (Unit Type Code) information from Major Command (MAJCOM) or Field Command (FLDCOM) sources, and output detailed container-level packing plans. It must support various container formats, be adaptable to different cargo profiles (including hazardous or classified items), and provide activity tracking and operational alerts to assist planners and personnel throughout the pack-out process. Solutions should prioritize user-centered design, enabling intuitive interaction through advanced HMI such as voice recognition, touch screens, or augment reality/virtual reality (AR/VR). The tool must be operable in contested or communications-degraded environments, offering edge-computing capabilities and the ability to sync with central systems when reconnected. This capability will directly enhance the USSF’s ability to execute rapid, distributed logistics operations with reduced cognitive burden on Airmen and Guardians. The topic is intended to stimulate innovative research and development (R&D) toward a dual-use solution with strong applicability in both defense and commercial logistics sectors   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Phase II goal is to develop and demonstrate a functional prototype system that addresses the USSF’s need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cargo packing and load planning for deployment and sustainment operations. The prototype should enable more rapid and accurate configuration of cargo across a range of container types and operational scenarios. It should support improved planning, activity tracking, and information flow in environments that may have limited communications or require flexibility for changing mission conditions. Phase II work is expected to include:   - Prototype Development: build a working software prototype that supports optimized planning and configuration of cargo. The system should accommodate various data inputs and packing constraints, including space, weight, timing, and priority of items.  - Operational Integration Context: demonstrate the prototype’s ability to support logistics personnel during cargo preparation and movement activities. This may include generating container-specific outputs, supporting real-time updates, or aligning with mission support functions such as maintenance scheduling or readiness tracking.  - Evaluation in Relevant Environment: develop a test plan and evaluate the prototype in an operationally representative setting. Capture performance metrics such as time reduction, accuracy of packing plans, user workload reduction, or adaptability to mission constraints.  - Transition Planning and Dual-Use Considerations: begin to define potential transition pathways, including DoD logistics operations and commercial applications. Consider compatibility with existing systems and outline next steps for operational deployment or commercial scaling.   Deliverables for Phase II may include:  - A functioning prototype software system;  - A technical report describing system capabilities, interfaces, and performance results;  - A summary of evaluation outcomes and user feedback;  - Documentation to support transition or further development;  - A commercialization and transition strategy aligned with potential military and commercial applications.   Phase II will deliver a validated prototype system that enables more efficient, informed, and agile cargo packing and planning. The solution should enhance operational readiness, reduce time and error in the packing process, and support integration with broader logistics and sustainment activities.   To facilitate the potential transition from Phase II to Phase III, a transition plan will be developed that outlines the steps necessary to ensure that the optimization solution is deployed and used effectively by government and commercial partners. The plan will include a timeline for deployment, a plan for identifying potential partners and customers, and a plan for marketing and selling the solution. The plan will also include a detailed description of the integration plan, and any necessary modifications or customizations needed to make the solution compatible with existing systems.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort for the RSP Optimization for Efficient Deployment SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization. The developed technology has dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. Military applications include RSP deployment and other supply chain management operations, as well as maintenance and load planning actions. The technology can help the military optimize its logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Commercial applications manufacturing, and distribution. The technology can help commercial organizations optimize their logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.   The expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, with a well-defined and validated software solution ready for commercialization. The technology will have been tested and validated in realistic environments, and any necessary modifications or customizations will have been made to ensure that it is compatible with existing systems and workflows. Additional information regarding transition planning includes identifying known government approvals required for deployment and any additional opportunities for deployment of the optimization solution within the government and commercial sectors. The integration plan will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure that the optimization solution is integrated seamlessly into their existing systems and workflows.   Overall, the expected Phase III effort for the ASTROPAC SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization, with dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. The expected TRL at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, and the transition planning will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure seamless integration into existing systems and workflows.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI & Autonomy   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an underwater sensor optimized for size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) that can be mounted on a small uncrewed boat to detect bathymetry and underwater hazards in shallow, bubbly environments.​   DESCRIPTION: There is an increasing need to enable U.S. Army sustainment and maneuver support operations through littoral environments, including shallow-water and surfzone based landings, in potentially contested regions. In particular, enabling maritime operations and autonomous distribution to support logistics over the shore for the Joint Forces was recently identified as an S&T priority. In these over-the-shore operations, mapping bathymetry and shallow water hazards (e.g., unexploded ordinance) are of primary importance to ensure safe, efficient, and effective force projection. On exposed coasts, bubbles from breaking waves are a typical environmental impediment that attenuate acoustic signals denying adequate sensing, which leaves crewed or uncrewed systems with limited situational awareness in a particularly challenging environment, arguably the most critical portion of any transit.​   Surfzone bubbles range in sizes, depending on whether they are part of the alpha plume (initial injection) with sizes ranging from cm to tens of micros or the gamma plume (resident plume of smaller bubbles), the both of which creates attenuation of acoustic signals (Deane G. B., 1997, 1999). Leighton (2010) highlighted methods to classify bubbles and reduce their clutter using a Twin Inverted Pair Sonar (TWIPS) signal, motivated by signals used by dolphins. This was examined in boat wakes by Leighton (2011). Lee (2016) highlights bubble’s non-linear response as a potential method for discerning bubbles from hard targets. Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least). Geometries should consider usage mounting on small uncrewed surface vehicles.   Deliver a reporting document: (1) a computer-aided design (CAD) model of developed technology(s) (2) the experimental procedures and results that demonstrate the process meets the performance requirements; (3) the developed system. A favorable performance evaluation will lead into Phase III applications. All research, development, and prototype designs shall be documented with detailed descriptions and specifications of the composition, fabrication, microstructure, and mechanical performance of the prototype repair materials.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a strong commercial hydrographic survey industry that could benefit from this technology. Hydrographic surveys are required as part of every USACE Civil Works beach and navigation project nationally, and are used widely within the commercial dredging industry and maritime safety industries.  Presently, operation in the surf-zone is constrained to low or non-breaking wave conditions, meaning the ability to collect these data are significantly weather-constrained.         REFERENCES:    https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/102/5/2671/558076/Sound-generation-and-air-entrainment-by-breaking   https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/29/7/1520-0485_1999_029_1393_aepabs_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display   https://pubs.aip.org/as       KEYWORDS: Surf Zone; Autonomy; Landing; Acoustics; Bubbles; Sensing; Underwater Sensing; Acoustic Sensors",

Breaking waves entrain air, creating bubble plumes that severely attenuate acoustic signals, limiting situational awareness for both crewed and uncrewed systems during crucial over-the-shore maneuvers. The objective is to develop a portable, ruggedized sensor system that can be mounted on small USVs to provide real-time, reliable bathymetry and detect underwater hazards (e.g., unexploded ordnance). The system must perform in shallow water, with a minimum reliable detection range as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. The program encourages innovative approaches, citing prior art in non-linear acoustics and specialized sonar signals (e.g., TWIPS) but remaining open to any acoustic or non-acoustic method that can achieve the objective.

The core problem is the severe attenuation of acoustic signals by bubbles from breaking waves, which blinds current sensors and hinders critical military logistics and maneuver operations. The program calls for the development of a SWAP-C optimized, ruggedized sensor—either acoustic or non-acoustic—capable of real-time bathymetry and hazard detection for integration onto small Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). A key requirement is the ability to reliably detect the seafloor from as close as 10 cm in these bubbly conditions. Phase I ($250k, 6 months) focuses on laboratory-based feasibility, while Phase II will develop and field-test a prototype. A strong dual-use and commercialization path is defined, targeting the multi-billion dollar hydrographic survey, dredging, and maritime construction industries, which face similar operational constraints. This opportunity is ideal for a collaborative team comprising a small business with expertise in sensor engineering and productization, and a research institution with deep knowledge of underwater acoustics, advanced signal processing, and/or novel sensing physics. Successful applicants will propose a breakthrough approach that moves beyond existing techniques and demonstrates a clear path to a fieldable, commercially viable product.",

          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI & Autonomy   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an underwater sensor optimized for size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) that can be mounted on a small uncrewed boat to detect bathymetry and underwater hazards in shallow, bubbly environments.​   DESCRIPTION: There is an increasing need to enable U.S. Army sustainment and maneuver support operations through littoral environments, including shallow-water and surfzone based landings, in potentially contested regions. In particular, enabling maritime operations and autonomous distribution to support logistics over the shore for the Joint Forces was recently identified as an S&T priority. In these over-the-shore operations, mapping bathymetry and shallow water hazards (e.g., unexploded ordinance) are of primary importance to ensure safe, efficient, and effective force projection. On exposed coasts, bubbles from breaking waves are a typical environmental impediment that attenuate acoustic signals denying adequate sensing, which leaves crewed or uncrewed systems with limited situational awareness in a particularly challenging environment, arguably the most critical portion of any transit.​   Surfzone bubbles range in sizes, depending on whether they are part of the alpha plume (initial injection) with sizes ranging from cm to tens of micros or the gamma plume (resident plume of smaller bubbles), the both of which creates attenuation of acoustic signals (Deane G. B., 1997, 1999). Leighton (2010) highlighted methods to classify bubbles and reduce their clutter using a Twin Inverted Pair Sonar (TWIPS) signal, motivated by signals used by dolphins. This was examined in boat wakes by Leighton (2011). Lee (2016) highlights bubble’s non-linear response as a potential method for discerning bubbles from hard targets. Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least). Geometries should consider usage mounting on small uncrewed surface vehicles.   Deliver a reporting document: (1) a computer-aided design (CAD) model of developed technology(s) (2) the experimental procedures and results that demonstrate the process meets the performance requirements; (3) the developed system. A favorable performance evaluation will lead into Phase III applications. All research, development, and prototype designs shall be documented with detailed descriptions and specifications of the composition, fabrication, microstructure, and mechanical performance of the prototype repair materials.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a strong commercial hydrographic survey industry that could benefit from this technology. Hydrographic surveys are required as part of every USACE Civil Works beach and navigation project nationally, and are used widely within the commercial dredging industry and maritime safety industries.  Presently, operation in the surf-zone is constrained to low or non-breaking wave conditions, meaning the ability to collect these data are significantly weather-constrained.         REFERENCES:    https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/102/5/2671/558076/Sound-generation-and-air-entrainment-by-breaking   https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/29/7/1520-0485_1999_029_1393_aepabs_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display   https://pubs.aip.org/as       KEYWORDS: Surf Zone; Autonomy; Landing; Acoustics; Bubbles; Sensing; Underwater Sensing; Acoustic Sensors",

Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least). Geometries should consider usage mounting on small uncrewed surface vehicles.   Deliver a reporting document: (1) a computer-aided design (CAD) model of developed technology(s) (2) the experimental procedures and results that demonstrate the process meets the performance requirements; (3) the developed system. A favorable performance evaluation will lead into Phase III applications. All research, development, and prototype designs shall be documented with detailed descriptions and specifications of the composition, fabrication, microstructure, and mechanical performance of the prototype repair materials.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a strong commercial hydrographic survey industry that could benefit from this technology. Hydrographic surveys are required as part of every USACE Civil Works beach and navigation project nationally, and are used widely within the commercial dredging industry and maritime safety industries.  Presently, operation in the surf-zone is constrained to low or non-breaking wave conditions, meaning the ability to collect these data are significantly weather-constrained.         REFERENCES:    https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/102/5/2671/558076/Sound-generation-and-air-entrainment-by-breaking   https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/29/7/1520-0485_1999_029_1393_aepabs_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display   https://pubs.aip.org/as       KEYWORDS: Surf Zone; Autonomy; Landing; Acoustics; Bubbles; Sensing; Underwater Sensing; Acoustic Sensors",

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled, interactive strategy game prototype to support training and simulation for Space Logistics and Sustainment. This Phase I effort will focus on conceptualizing game mechanics, modeling realistic logistics scenarios, and developing a minimal viable simulation environment that integrates decision-support elements, human-machine interaction, and adversarial modeling. The prototype should provide a foundation for immersive training and concept of operations (CONOPS) experimentation aligned with U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment strategy.   DESCRIPTION: The USSF requires advanced training tools to prepare Guardians and logistics planners for the complex challenges of space sustainment, including adversarial interference, orbital constraints, and dynamic resupply conditions. Traditional wargaming and training platforms lack the interactivity, realism, and adaptability needed to prepare personnel for next-generation space logistics missions. Project SpaceKnight will address this gap by developing a proof-of-concept, AI-driven strategy game that simulates logistics planning and sustainment in contested space environments. This Phase I effort will focus on:   - Designing core game mechanics for both single-player and multiplayer scenarios;  - Modeling realistic constraints such as launch timing, fuel, orbital mechanics, and adversarial disruption;  - Prototyping AI-driven scenario generation to reflect real-world mission variables;  - Exploring immersive learning options using augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) and advanced human-machine interfaces;  - Demonstrating how the simulation environment can support decision-making, CONOPS exploration, and supply chain risk analysis.   The objective is to establish feasibility, validate early design elements, and lay the groundwork for a full-featured training and wargaming platform in future phases.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to establish the feasibility of SpaceKnight as an AI-enabled, game-based training and simulation tool for space logistics and sustainment. This phase will focus on conceptual design, initial prototyping, and early validation of the system's training value and operational relevance. Key activities include:   - Develop the conceptual architecture and game design, including AI logic, user interaction models, and scenario components.  - Create a functional prototype capable of simulating at least one realistic logistics or sustainment scenario, incorporating basic adversary dynamics, launch constraints, or resource limitations.  - Build an AI-driven scenario generation framework that enables dynamic mission variables and training variability.  - Conduct stakeholder interviews with USSF logistics personnel, Space Systems Command (SSC) training teams, and other relevant users to inform use cases and requirements.  - Evaluate and document how the prototype enhances decision-making, CONOPS exploration, and learning outcomes.   Deliverables may include:  - Conceptual game design and system architecture document.  - Prototype demonstration of a simulated logistics/sustainment scenario.  - Initial AI-based scenario generation engine.  - Use case study on training and decision impact.  - Stakeholder interview report and requirements validation summary.   PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to advance SpaceKnight from a Phase I prototype to a fully operational training and simulation platform for space logistics and sustainment. This phase will deliver a complete, AI-enabled game environment capable of supporting multi-user training, immersive planning, and digital decision support aligned with real-world mission variables. Key activities include:   - Develop and deploy a complete version of the SpaceKnight platform, incorporating realistic logistical and operational constraints such as fuel consumption, orbital mechanics, launch windows, and adversary behavior.  - Expand system functionality to support both turn-based and real-time scenarios in single-player and multiplayer formats, enabling distributed team exercises.  - Integrate AR/VR capabilities for enhanced immersion and scenario visualization, with support for advanced human-machine interfaces (e.g., voice, gesture, touchscreen).  - Build a robust analytics dashboard to track user performance, mission outcomes, and training metrics.  - Conduct testing in tabletop exercises (TTX) and wargaming environments to validate training efficacy and operational planning utility.  - Initiate integration with existing DoD training and learning platforms, ensuring alignment with USSF and Joint logistics frameworks.   Deliverables may include:  - Fully operational SpaceKnight simulation platform (unclassified, with capability for classified scenario extensions).  - Multi-user functionality for collaborative, distributed exercises.  - Constraint engines simulating mission realism (e.g., launch infrastructure, ground station coverage, resource availability).  - Immersive AR/VR module and interactive planning interfaces.  - Mission analytics dashboard and performance tracking tools.  - Testing and training report summarizing system effectiveness in operational exercises.  - Transition and deployment plan for DoD adoption and broader training integration.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III military applications, SpaceKnight will transition into an operational training, planning, and wargaming platform for use across SSC, USSF, and broader Joint logistics communities. Key applications include:   - Training Tool for Logistics Forces: Enhances Guardian and Airman readiness through immersive, scenario-based learning focused on contested, orbital sustainment operations.  - Strategic and Tactical Wargaming: Supports CONOPS development and mission rehearsal through dynamic adversary modeling and real-time decision environments.   Integration with Digital Twin Systems: Enables synchronization with broader planning ecosystems (e.g., VS-CDF or the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture (COP) Logistics Module) for end-to-end simulation and decision support.   For commercial applications, the underlying AI-driven simulation engine and gamified interface can be adapted for commercial use in sectors including space logistics, supply chain training, and strategic planning. Use cases include:   - Aerospace & Logistics Workforce Development: Provides high-fidelity, simulation-based training for companies managing spaceport operations, satellite logistics, or intermodal transportation.  - Space Sector Investment & Concept Testing: Serves as a strategic learning environment for commercial space startups, incubators, and venture stakeholders to test logistics models and resiliency planning.  - Academic & Defense Industry Simulation Tools: Offers customizable wargaming environments for defense contractors, think tanks, and universities conducting research on space sustainment and supply chain dynamics.   For the transition plan, SpaceKnight will be transitioned via coordination with SSC, training directorates, and defense education institutions for military use. In parallel, commercial licensing opportunities will be explored with aerospace firms, logistics tech developers, and academic partners seeking simulation-based decision support platforms. The anticipated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at Phase III Entry is TRL 8 or 9, following successful validation in training environments and operational planning exercises.

            "summary": "This DoD SBIR opportunity, 'Project SpaceKnight,' seeks the development of an AI-driven, interactive wargaming platform to train U.S. Space Force (USSF) personnel in contested space logistics and sustainment. The project aims to create a dynamic, gamified simulation that models realistic constraints such as orbital mechanics, adversarial actions, and resource limitations, moving beyond traditional static training methods. The goal is to enhance Guardian readiness, support Concept of Operations (CONOPS) development, and facilitate mission rehearsal.\n\nKey capabilities and expertise needed include a strong background in Artificial Intelligence for dynamic scenario generation, game design and development, realistic physics-based simulation, and human-machine interface design, including AR/VR. A deep understanding of military space operations, particularly USSF logistics and sustainment challenges as outlined in USSF doctrine, is critical. \n\nThe innovation potential lies in creating an adaptive, immersive learning environment that provides data-driven feedback and supports both single-player training and multi-user collaborative exercises. The project has a clear, phased approach, starting with a feasibility prototype in Phase I, an operational platform in Phase II, and transition to both military and commercial use in Phase III. Collaboration with USSF stakeholders like Space Systems Command (SSC) is required. This opportunity is ideal for agile tech companies with interdisciplinary teams ready to tackle complex, high-impact national security challenges with dual-use potential in the growing commercial space and logistics sectors. Compliance with ITAR/EAR regulations is mandatory."

          "Topic Title": "Project SpaceKnight: Interactive AI Simulation for USSF Space Sustainment and Contested Logistics Wargaming",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled, interactive strategy game prototype to support training and simulation for Space Logistics and Sustainment. This Phase I effort will focus on conceptualizing game mechanics, modeling realistic logistics scenarios, and developing a minimal viable simulation environment that integrates decision-support elements, human-machine interaction, and adversarial modeling. The prototype should provide a foundation for immersive training and concept of operations (CONOPS) experimentation aligned with U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment strategy.   DESCRIPTION: The USSF requires advanced training tools to prepare Guardians and logistics planners for the complex challenges of space sustainment, including adversarial interference, orbital constraints, and dynamic resupply conditions. Traditional wargaming and training platforms lack the interactivity, realism, and adaptability needed to prepare personnel for next-generation space logistics missions. Project SpaceKnight will address this gap by developing a proof-of-concept, AI-driven strategy game that simulates logistics planning and sustainment in contested space environments. This Phase I effort will focus on:   - Designing core game mechanics for both single-player and multiplayer scenarios;  - Modeling realistic constraints such as launch timing, fuel, orbital mechanics, and adversarial disruption;  - Prototyping AI-driven scenario generation to reflect real-world mission variables;  - Exploring immersive learning options using augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) and advanced human-machine interfaces;  - Demonstrating how the simulation environment can support decision-making, CONOPS exploration, and supply chain risk analysis.   The objective is to establish feasibility, validate early design elements, and lay the groundwork for a full-featured training and wargaming platform in future phases.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to establish the feasibility of SpaceKnight as an AI-enabled, game-based training and simulation tool for space logistics and sustainment. This phase will focus on conceptual design, initial prototyping, and early validation of the system's training value and operational relevance. Key activities include:   - Develop the conceptual architecture and game design, including AI logic, user interaction models, and scenario components.  - Create a functional prototype capable of simulating at least one realistic logistics or sustainment scenario, incorporating basic adversary dynamics, launch constraints, or resource limitations.  - Build an AI-driven scenario generation framework that enables dynamic mission variables and training variability.  - Conduct stakeholder interviews with USSF logistics personnel, Space Systems Command (SSC) training teams, and other relevant users to inform use cases and requirements.  - Evaluate and document how the prototype enhances decision-making, CONOPS exploration, and learning outcomes.   Deliverables may include:  - Conceptual game design and system architecture document.  - Prototype demonstration of a simulated logistics/sustainment scenario.  - Initial AI-based scenario generation engine.  - Use case study on training and decision impact.  - Stakeholder interview report and requirements validation summary.   PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to advance SpaceKnight from a Phase I prototype to a fully operational training and simulation platform for space logistics and sustainment. This phase will deliver a complete, AI-enabled game environment capable of supporting multi-user training, immersive planning, and digital decision support aligned with real-world mission variables. Key activities include:   - Develop and deploy a complete version of the SpaceKnight platform, incorporating realistic logistical and operational constraints such as fuel consumption, orbital mechanics, launch windows, and adversary behavior.  - Expand system functionality to support both turn-based and real-time scenarios in single-player and multiplayer formats, enabling distributed team exercises.  - Integrate AR/VR capabilities for enhanced immersion and scenario visualization, with support for advanced human-machine interfaces (e.g., voice, gesture, touchscreen).  - Build a robust analytics dashboard to track user performance, mission outcomes, and training metrics.  - Conduct testing in tabletop exercises (TTX) and wargaming environments to validate training efficacy and operational planning utility.  - Initiate integration with existing DoD training and learning platforms, ensuring alignment with USSF and Joint logistics frameworks.   Deliverables may include:  - Fully operational SpaceKnight simulation platform (unclassified, with capability for classified scenario extensions).  - Multi-user functionality for collaborative, distributed exercises.  - Constraint engines simulating mission realism (e.g., launch infrastructure, ground station coverage, resource availability).  - Immersive AR/VR module and interactive planning interfaces.  - Mission analytics dashboard and performance tracking tools.  - Testing and training report summarizing system effectiveness in operational exercises.  - Transition and deployment plan for DoD adoption and broader training integration.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III military applications, SpaceKnight will transition into an operational training, planning, and wargaming platform for use across SSC, USSF, and broader Joint logistics communities. Key applications include:   - Training Tool for Logistics Forces: Enhances Guardian and Airman readiness through immersive, scenario-based learning focused on contested, orbital sustainment operations.  - Strategic and Tactical Wargaming: Supports CONOPS development and mission rehearsal through dynamic adversary modeling and real-time decision environments.   Integration with Digital Twin Systems: Enables synchronization with broader planning ecosystems (e.g., VS-CDF or the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture (COP) Logistics Module) for end-to-end simulation and decision support.   For commercial applications, the underlying AI-driven simulation engine and gamified interface can be adapted for commercial use in sectors including space logistics, supply chain training, and strategic planning. Use cases include:   - Aerospace & Logistics Workforce Development: Provides high-fidelity, simulation-based training for companies managing spaceport operations, satellite logistics, or intermodal transportation.  - Space Sector Investment & Concept Testing: Serves as a strategic learning environment for commercial space startups, incubators, and venture stakeholders to test logistics models and resiliency planning.  - Academic & Defense Industry Simulation Tools: Offers customizable wargaming environments for defense contractors, think tanks, and universities conducting research on space sustainment and supply chain dynamics.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to develop a scalable, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled decision-support framework that enables faster, more informed prioritization of emerging technologies across the space sustainment and logistics enterprise. Project AXIS 54 will equip cross-functional teams with structured tools to assess innovation alignment, technical maturity, and operational relevance—reducing transition friction and accelerating mission-impactful capabilities. The Phase I objective is to design and validate core framework components, AI integration pathways, and representative use cases to guide prototype development in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Modern defense innovation often excels at the edge but stalls at the center—where promising technologies struggle to transition due to fragmented visibility, misaligned priorities, and lack of actionable evaluation tools. From concept to prototype, many initiatives fail to bridge the gap between innovation and operational impact. Project AXIS 54 addresses this challenge by delivering a practical, AI-enabled framework to assess, prioritize, and align emerging technologies with mission objectives. Designed for use by capability developers, acquisition teams, and decision-makers across the space logistics and sustainment enterprise, AXIS 54 will support:   - Scoring and visualization of initiatives based on operational relevance, technical maturity, transition readiness, and system feasibility.  - Warfighter-centric planning using intuitive visual models that promote alignment across stakeholders.  - Feedback loops that track early-stage innovations and guide them toward successful integration.   AI will serve as a core enabler, automating pattern recognition across portfolios, flagging integration risks, and surfacing dependencies. Machine learning models will continuously refine prioritization logic using real-world datasets, improving insight fidelity and accelerating informed decision-making. Aligned with the Secretary of Defense’s 17 priority areas—including readiness, innovation speed, and ecosystem resilience—AXIS 54 enables structured yet flexible evaluation of technology portfolios. It empowers leaders to elevate the most mission-relevant innovations, reinforcing readiness and sustainment in support of high-priority U.S. Space Force (USSF) operations. Instead of delivering a rigid platform, AXIS 54 will offer a modular toolkit—scalable for enterprise planning and adaptable for agile experimentation teams. It ensures that initiatives with the greatest potential for lethality, agility, and sustainability are identified early, matured strategically, and transitioned efficiently.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to establish the foundational elements of a modular decision-support toolkit that enables cross-functional teams to assess, align, and communicate the operational value of emerging technologies. Phase I focuses on validating a scalable, AI-enabled framework that helps prioritize innovation efforts in alignment with Space Systems Command (SSC), SpaceWERX, and broader USSF mission objectives. The scope and key tasks for this Phase I effort include:    1. Framework Blueprint Development – Design a practical scoring and assessment model incorporating real-world evaluation criteria—such as value-to-mission, maturity level, transition feasibility, and sustainment impact—used by SSC/S4 and innovation stakeholders.  2. Use Case Mapping – Apply the framework to representative scenarios drawn from current innovation pipelines (e.g., autonomous logistics, orbital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), digital sustainment), validating its applicability across diverse technology verticals.  3. Interface Prototypes – Create initial interface mockups or functional wireframes that demonstrate how program managers, acquisition officers, and mission owners would interact with the toolkit for planning and decision-making.  4. AI/machine learning (ML) System Architecture – Define AI design elements, including recommended data structures, training datasets, pattern recognition methods, and inference logic to be developed in Phase II.  5. Transition Touchpoints Identification – Identify ideal pilot environments and stakeholder communities for Phase II implementation, including where and how the system will be integrated into operational workflows.   Deliverables may include:  - Architecture and scoring model documentation.  - Scenario-based walkthroughs illustrating framework application.  - Mockups or interactive wireframes for user interface concepts.  - Initial AI/ML system design overview and recommended datasets.  - Phase II pilot strategy and stakeholder engagement plan.   PHASE II: The objective for Phase II is to develop and deliver a functional, AI-enabled prototype of the AXIS 54 framework that supports enterprise-level innovation planning, technology prioritization, and transition decision-making. The system will be co-developed with a government partner—such as SSC/S4, SpaceWERX, or a relevant program office—to ensure alignment with mission needs and real-world operational workflows. Consider the following during the Phase II approach:   - Collaborative Development: Work closely with government stakeholders to tailor the toolkit’s capabilities to actual use cases, workflows, and decision environments. This ensures the tool enhances—not disrupts—existing processes for capability planning and tech transition.  - AI/ML Integration: Deploy and train machine learning models using curated, relevant datasets to support prioritization scoring, dependency mapping, and readiness forecasting. Emphasis will be placed on explainability, transparency, and user trust.  - Operational Use Cases: Apply the prototype to live or recent innovation efforts (e.g., Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) portfolios, non-Program of Record (non-POR) pathfinders) to demonstrate its effectiveness in streamlining evaluations, surfacing transition risks, and identifying portfolio synergies.  - User-Centered Design: Refine visual interfaces, dashboards, and interaction pathways based on feedback from capability developers, program managers (PMs), and mission owners to ensure usability and adoption.   Deliverables may include:  - Fully functional AXIS 54 prototype system.  - Integrated AI/ML modules for initiative scoring, risk flagging, and value analysis.  - Pilot demonstrations in one or more operational environments.  - Stakeholder feedback report and performance evaluation.  - Phase III transition plan with pathways for broader DoD and commercial adoption.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III, military applications include:   - Strengthens strategic technology insertion and long-term sustainment planning across SSC portfolios.  - Institutionalizes repeatable transition pathways for SBIR/STTR efforts, Pathfinder projects, and other innovation pipelines.  - Provides Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and acquisition leaders with visibility into technology value, maturity, and risk throughout the development lifecycle.  - Enables structured evaluation and integration of non-POR capabilities that offer high operational value to the warfighter.  - Leverages AI/ML to surface emerging opportunities, flag integration risks, and support real-time, enterprise-level trade-off analysis.   Commercial applications may include:  - Highly applicable to organizations managing complex research and development (R&D) pipelines, particularly those with dual-use technology portfolios.  - Supports strategic planning and prioritization in commercial aerospace, spaceport logistics, advanced manufacturing, and defense-adjacent sectors.  - Improves communication and alignment between technical, operational, and business leadership in innovation-centric enterprises.  - Offers AI-driven portfolio analytics and insights to enhance innovation strategy, reduce investment risk, and accelerate time-to-market.   For transition pathways, the government opportunities may involve the adoption through SSC, SpaceWERX, and/or other innovation-focused DoD entities. Private sector opportunities may involve commercial deployment through SaaS or enterprise software licensing for R&D strategy, innovation portfolio management, and investment planning.   Ultimately, AXIS 54 bridges the gap between innovation and implementation—equipping both military and commercial decision-makers with a robust, AI-enabled framework to make faster, more informed decisions about which technologies to advance and how best to deploy them.

          "Topic Title": "Project AXIS 54: AI-Enabled Framework for Space Sustainment Technology Prioritization",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to develop a scalable, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled decision-support framework that enables faster, more informed prioritization of emerging technologies across the space sustainment and logistics enterprise. Project AXIS 54 will equip cross-functional teams with structured tools to assess innovation alignment, technical maturity, and operational relevance—reducing transition friction and accelerating mission-impactful capabilities. The Phase I objective is to design and validate core framework components, AI integration pathways, and representative use cases to guide prototype development in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Modern defense innovation often excels at the edge but stalls at the center—where promising technologies struggle to transition due to fragmented visibility, misaligned priorities, and lack of actionable evaluation tools. From concept to prototype, many initiatives fail to bridge the gap between innovation and operational impact. Project AXIS 54 addresses this challenge by delivering a practical, AI-enabled framework to assess, prioritize, and align emerging technologies with mission objectives. Designed for use by capability developers, acquisition teams, and decision-makers across the space logistics and sustainment enterprise, AXIS 54 will support:   - Scoring and visualization of initiatives based on operational relevance, technical maturity, transition readiness, and system feasibility.  - Warfighter-centric planning using intuitive visual models that promote alignment across stakeholders.  - Feedback loops that track early-stage innovations and guide them toward successful integration.   AI will serve as a core enabler, automating pattern recognition across portfolios, flagging integration risks, and surfacing dependencies. Machine learning models will continuously refine prioritization logic using real-world datasets, improving insight fidelity and accelerating informed decision-making. Aligned with the Secretary of Defense’s 17 priority areas—including readiness, innovation speed, and ecosystem resilience—AXIS 54 enables structured yet flexible evaluation of technology portfolios. It empowers leaders to elevate the most mission-relevant innovations, reinforcing readiness and sustainment in support of high-priority U.S. Space Force (USSF) operations. Instead of delivering a rigid platform, AXIS 54 will offer a modular toolkit—scalable for enterprise planning and adaptable for agile experimentation teams. It ensures that initiatives with the greatest potential for lethality, agility, and sustainability are identified early, matured strategically, and transitioned efficiently.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to establish the foundational elements of a modular decision-support toolkit that enables cross-functional teams to assess, align, and communicate the operational value of emerging technologies. Phase I focuses on validating a scalable, AI-enabled framework that helps prioritize innovation efforts in alignment with Space Systems Command (SSC), SpaceWERX, and broader USSF mission objectives. The scope and key tasks for this Phase I effort include:    1. Framework Blueprint Development – Design a practical scoring and assessment model incorporating real-world evaluation criteria—such as value-to-mission, maturity level, transition feasibility, and sustainment impact—used by SSC/S4 and innovation stakeholders.  2. Use Case Mapping – Apply the framework to representative scenarios drawn from current innovation pipelines (e.g., autonomous logistics, orbital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), digital sustainment), validating its applicability across diverse technology verticals.  3. Interface Prototypes – Create initial interface mockups or functional wireframes that demonstrate how program managers, acquisition officers, and mission owners would interact with the toolkit for planning and decision-making.  4. AI/machine learning (ML) System Architecture – Define AI design elements, including recommended data structures, training datasets, pattern recognition methods, and inference logic to be developed in Phase II.  5. Transition Touchpoints Identification – Identify ideal pilot environments and stakeholder communities for Phase II implementation, including where and how the system will be integrated into operational workflows.   Deliverables may include:  - Architecture and scoring model documentation.  - Scenario-based walkthroughs illustrating framework application.  - Mockups or interactive wireframes for user interface concepts.  - Initial AI/ML system design overview and recommended datasets.  - Phase II pilot strategy and stakeholder engagement plan.   PHASE II: The objective for Phase II is to develop and deliver a functional, AI-enabled prototype of the AXIS 54 framework that supports enterprise-level innovation planning, technology prioritization, and transition decision-making. The system will be co-developed with a government partner—such as SSC/S4, SpaceWERX, or a relevant program office—to ensure alignment with mission needs and real-world operational workflows. Consider the following during the Phase II approach:   - Collaborative Development: Work closely with government stakeholders to tailor the toolkit’s capabilities to actual use cases, workflows, and decision environments. This ensures the tool enhances—not disrupts—existing processes for capability planning and tech transition.  - AI/ML Integration: Deploy and train machine learning models using curated, relevant datasets to support prioritization scoring, dependency mapping, and readiness forecasting. Emphasis will be placed on explainability, transparency, and user trust.  - Operational Use Cases: Apply the prototype to live or recent innovation efforts (e.g., Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) portfolios, non-Program of Record (non-POR) pathfinders) to demonstrate its effectiveness in streamlining evaluations, surfacing transition risks, and identifying portfolio synergies.  - User-Centered Design: Refine visual interfaces, dashboards, and interaction pathways based on feedback from capability developers, program managers (PMs), and mission owners to ensure usability and adoption.   Deliverables may include:  - Fully functional AXIS 54 prototype system.  - Integrated AI/ML modules for initiative scoring, risk flagging, and value analysis.  - Pilot demonstrations in one or more operational environments.  - Stakeholder feedback report and performance evaluation.  - Phase III transition plan with pathways for broader DoD and commercial adoption.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III, military applications include:   - Strengthens strategic technology insertion and long-term sustainment planning across SSC portfolios.  - Institutionalizes repeatable transition pathways for SBIR/STTR efforts, Pathfinder projects, and other innovation pipelines.  - Provides Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and acquisition leaders with visibility into technology value, maturity, and risk throughout the development lifecycle.  - Enables structured evaluation and integration of non-POR capabilities that offer high operational value to the warfighter.  - Leverages AI/ML to surface emerging opportunities, flag integration risks, and support real-time, enterprise-level trade-off analysis.   Commercial applications may include:  - Highly applicable to organizations managing complex research and development (R&D) pipelines, particularly those with dual-use technology portfolios.  - Supports strategic planning and prioritization in commercial aerospace, spaceport logistics, advanced manufacturing, and defense-adjacent sectors.  - Improves communication and alignment between technical, operational, and business leadership in innovation-centric enterprises.  - Offers AI-driven portfolio analytics and insights to enhance innovation strategy, reduce investment risk, and accelerate time-to-market.   For transition pathways, the government opportunities may involve the adoption through SSC, SpaceWERX, and/or other innovation-focused DoD entities. Private sector opportunities may involve commercial deployment through SaaS or enterprise software licensing for R&D strategy, innovation portfolio management, and investment planning.   Ultimately, AXIS 54 bridges the gap between innovation and implementation—equipping both military and commercial decision-makers with a robust, AI-enabled framework to make faster, more informed decisions about which technologies to advance and how best to deploy them.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to establish the technical feasibility of applying Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum Optimization (QO) to space logistics planning, demand forecasting, and mobility optimization. This effort will develop and benchmark a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for a representative logistics scenario, assessing performance improvements over classical models. The Phase I goal is to validate the potential of QML/QO to enhance decision speed, adaptability, and mission resilience in dynamic, contested environments—laying the foundation for a scalable platform to be developed in Phase II. This aligns with the U.S. Space Force (USSF) Mission Sustainment Strategy and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) objectives for digital logistics modernization and survivable supply chain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The Department of the Air Force (DAF) and USSF face escalating complexity in sustaining agile, resilient logistics across terrestrial, orbital, and emerging space environments. Existing logistics planning systems are overly manual, computationally limited, and poorly suited for dynamic, contested scenarios. As logistics demands expand to include rapid orbital resupply, lunar outposts, and interplanetary assets, there is an urgent need for advanced decision-support tools. Hybrid quantum-classical computing approaches—including QML and QO—have demonstrated early promise in tackling combinatorially complex logistics challenges, such as:   - Reducing compute time by orders of magnitude for vehicle routing problems (VRP), job scheduling, and inventory optimization.  - Enabling real-time planning adaptations under operational stressors and adversarial disruptions.   - Scaling across terrestrial, orbital, lunar, and interplanetary logistics architectures.   Core capability areas to be explored in this effort include:  1. Quantum-Enhanced Demand Forecasting: Leveraging QML to model operational and environmental data, enabling superior responsiveness in uncertain and fast-changing mission environments.  2. Hybrid Quantum Optimization for Routing & Scheduling: Applying quantum algorithms—such as quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) and quantum annealing—to solve NP-hard logistics problems and benchmarking them against classical methods.  3. Mission-Aware, Real-Time Logistics Planning: Integrating real-time data (e.g., weather, adversary actions, orbital mechanics) into optimization engines for continuous re-planning and mission adaptation.  4. Resilient, Contested Logistics Management: Modeling logistics risk under degraded conditions and exploring blockchain-enabled logistics chains for verifiability and control in adversarial domains.  5. Dual-Use and Digital Integration: Aligning with Logistics 4.0 transformation goals by enabling interoperability with DoD digital twins, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled mobility planning tools, and autonomous logistics systems.   Phase I will explore technical feasibility, prototype hybrid algorithmic models, and establish performance baselines. This effort directly supports the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy by advancing decision advantage, predictive planning, and mission survivability through next-generation logistics computing.   PHASE I: The objective for Phase I is to establish the technical feasibility and operational relevance of QML and QO for enhancing space logistics planning and demand forecasting. Phase I will focus on developing and evaluating a hybrid quantum-classical approach to solve logistics challenges such as dynamic routing, scheduling, or inventory management in space and contested terrestrial environments. Key tasks include:   - Develop a prototype algorithm or simulation that applies QML or QO techniques to a relevant logistics use case (e.g., vehicle routing, resupply scheduling, or demand forecasting).  - Construct a hybrid quantum-classical model, utilizing Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, classical decomposition strategies, and variational quantum algorithms where applicable.  - Benchmark the quantum-enabled solution against traditional classical optimization models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability under uncertainty.  - Engage logistics stakeholders (USSF, Space Systems Command (SSC), U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to validate use case relevance and gather mission-specific planning requirements.   Deliverables may include:  - A working prototype simulation or algorithm test case demonstrating the selected quantum technique.   - A comparative analysis report detailing performance trade-offs between quantum and classical approaches.   - A stakeholder engagement report summarizing feedback, mission alignment, and integration opportunities.   - A Phase II roadmap outlining pathways for algorithm maturation, scalability improvements, and field validation in real-world operational environments.    PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional, scalable quantum-enhanced logistics optimization platform using QML and QO. This system will integrate with operational logistics architectures from USSF, U.S. Air Force (USAF), and USTRANSCOM to enable real-time, resilient, and predictive decision-making for space and terrestrial sustainment operations. Key focus areas include:   - Platform Development: Build a full-stack hybrid quantum-classical optimization engine, leveraging QUBO formulations, quantum annealing, and/or variational quantum algorithms to solve NP-hard logistics problems at scale.  - System Integration: Develop secure and interoperable APIs to connect the platform with existing DoD logistics systems, digital twin architectures, and planning tools (e.g., Spaceport Common Operating Picture, AI-based cargo management platforms).  - Operational Validation: Apply the platform to mission-relevant use cases such as dynamic routing and scheduling under degraded or adversarial conditions, real-time resupply logistics and campaign planning, and mobility as well as sustainment optimization across orbital, lunar, and terrestrial nodes.   - Human-Machine Interface: Design an intuitive user interface for planners, analysts, and logisticians, enabling transparent interaction with quantum-driven outputs.  - Performance Benchmarking: Conduct comparative analysis of platform performance versus classical optimization solutions in representative mission environments.   Deliverables may include:  - A scalable QML/QO optimization prototype with web or edge deployment capability.  - Integration interfaces (APIs) for real-time data exchange with DoD systems and digital twins.   - Operational test results and benchmarking report, demonstrating improvements in speed, accuracy, and mission adaptability.   - A detailed Phase III transition plan, outlining technical, programmatic, and commercial pathways for full deployment.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III, the quantum-enabled logistics optimization platform will support high-priority defense missions requiring resilient, adaptive, and real-time logistics decision-making in contested and dynamic environments. Key applications include:   - Dynamic and Survivable Space Logistics: For USSF, AMC, Space Operations Command (SpOC), and SSC, enabling real-time resupply and routing under adversarial conditions.  - Mission Planning in Great Power Competition: Support logistics strategy and sustainment under threat conditions, denial-of-service environments, and complex global mobility scenarios.  - Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and Rapid Global Mobility: Enhance deployment timelines, asset utilization, and supply chain resilience across air and space domains.   The platform will also serve multiple high-demand commercial sectors facing complex, dynamic logistics challenges, including:  - Space Cargo and Orbital Routing: Enable predictive cargo planning for commercial spaceports, launch providers, and satellite resupply networks.  - Global Supply Chain Optimization: Serve aerospace, maritime, and automotive firms by improving cost-efficiency, resilience, and routing under uncertainty.  - AI-Quantum Logistics Tools: Provide a new class of logistics planning products that combine AI prediction with quantum optimization—ideal for logistics automation, risk forecasting, and multi-modal scheduling in large-scale networks.   The target Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is TRL 7, 8, or 9 achieved through successful operational prototype demonstration, integration into live mission environments, and commercial product adaptation.   For the transition strategy, consider a DoD transition path by working directly with SSC, USTRANSCOM, and logistics operators to embed the platform into operational workflows and digital twin environments and a commercialization path partnering with space logistics firms, global supply chain integrators, and quantum computing vendors to deploy the platform as a commercial software as a service (SaaS) or edge-integrated tool.

          "Topic Title": "Quantum for Space Logistics Demand Planning & Optimization",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to establish the technical feasibility of applying Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum Optimization (QO) to space logistics planning, demand forecasting, and mobility optimization. This effort will develop and benchmark a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for a representative logistics scenario, assessing performance improvements over classical models. The Phase I goal is to validate the potential of QML/QO to enhance decision speed, adaptability, and mission resilience in dynamic, contested environments—laying the foundation for a scalable platform to be developed in Phase II. This aligns with the U.S. Space Force (USSF) Mission Sustainment Strategy and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) objectives for digital logistics modernization and survivable supply chain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The Department of the Air Force (DAF) and USSF face escalating complexity in sustaining agile, resilient logistics across terrestrial, orbital, and emerging space environments. Existing logistics planning systems are overly manual, computationally limited, and poorly suited for dynamic, contested scenarios. As logistics demands expand to include rapid orbital resupply, lunar outposts, and interplanetary assets, there is an urgent need for advanced decision-support tools. Hybrid quantum-classical computing approaches—including QML and QO—have demonstrated early promise in tackling combinatorially complex logistics challenges, such as:   - Reducing compute time by orders of magnitude for vehicle routing problems (VRP), job scheduling, and inventory optimization.  - Enabling real-time planning adaptations under operational stressors and adversarial disruptions.   - Scaling across terrestrial, orbital, lunar, and interplanetary logistics architectures.   Core capability areas to be explored in this effort include:  1. Quantum-Enhanced Demand Forecasting: Leveraging QML to model operational and environmental data, enabling superior responsiveness in uncertain and fast-changing mission environments.  2. Hybrid Quantum Optimization for Routing & Scheduling: Applying quantum algorithms—such as quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) and quantum annealing—to solve NP-hard logistics problems and benchmarking them against classical methods.  3. Mission-Aware, Real-Time Logistics Planning: Integrating real-time data (e.g., weather, adversary actions, orbital mechanics) into optimization engines for continuous re-planning and mission adaptation.  4. Resilient, Contested Logistics Management: Modeling logistics risk under degraded conditions and exploring blockchain-enabled logistics chains for verifiability and control in adversarial domains.  5. Dual-Use and Digital Integration: Aligning with Logistics 4.0 transformation goals by enabling interoperability with DoD digital twins, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled mobility planning tools, and autonomous logistics systems.   Phase I will explore technical feasibility, prototype hybrid algorithmic models, and establish performance baselines. This effort directly supports the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy by advancing decision advantage, predictive planning, and mission survivability through next-generation logistics computing.   PHASE I: The objective for Phase I is to establish the technical feasibility and operational relevance of QML and QO for enhancing space logistics planning and demand forecasting. Phase I will focus on developing and evaluating a hybrid quantum-classical approach to solve logistics challenges such as dynamic routing, scheduling, or inventory management in space and contested terrestrial environments. Key tasks include:   - Develop a prototype algorithm or simulation that applies QML or QO techniques to a relevant logistics use case (e.g., vehicle routing, resupply scheduling, or demand forecasting).  - Construct a hybrid quantum-classical model, utilizing Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, classical decomposition strategies, and variational quantum algorithms where applicable.  - Benchmark the quantum-enabled solution against traditional classical optimization models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability under uncertainty.  - Engage logistics stakeholders (USSF, Space Systems Command (SSC), U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to validate use case relevance and gather mission-specific planning requirements.   Deliverables may include:  - A working prototype simulation or algorithm test case demonstrating the selected quantum technique.   - A comparative analysis report detailing performance trade-offs between quantum and classical approaches.   - A stakeholder engagement report summarizing feedback, mission alignment, and integration opportunities.   - A Phase II roadmap outlining pathways for algorithm maturation, scalability improvements, and field validation in real-world operational environments.    PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional, scalable quantum-enhanced logistics optimization platform using QML and QO. This system will integrate with operational logistics architectures from USSF, U.S. Air Force (USAF), and USTRANSCOM to enable real-time, resilient, and predictive decision-making for space and terrestrial sustainment operations. Key focus areas include:   - Platform Development: Build a full-stack hybrid quantum-classical optimization engine, leveraging QUBO formulations, quantum annealing, and/or variational quantum algorithms to solve NP-hard logistics problems at scale.  - System Integration: Develop secure and interoperable APIs to connect the platform with existing DoD logistics systems, digital twin architectures, and planning tools (e.g., Spaceport Common Operating Picture, AI-based cargo management platforms).  - Operational Validation: Apply the platform to mission-relevant use cases such as dynamic routing and scheduling under degraded or adversarial conditions, real-time resupply logistics and campaign planning, and mobility as well as sustainment optimization across orbital, lunar, and terrestrial nodes.   - Human-Machine Interface: Design an intuitive user interface for planners, analysts, and logisticians, enabling transparent interaction with quantum-driven outputs.  - Performance Benchmarking: Conduct comparative analysis of platform performance versus classical optimization solutions in representative mission environments.   Deliverables may include:  - A scalable QML/QO optimization prototype with web or edge deployment capability.  - Integration interfaces (APIs) for real-time data exchange with DoD systems and digital twins.   - Operational test results and benchmarking report, demonstrating improvements in speed, accuracy, and mission adaptability.   - A detailed Phase III transition plan, outlining technical, programmatic, and commercial pathways for full deployment.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III, the quantum-enabled logistics optimization platform will support high-priority defense missions requiring resilient, adaptive, and real-time logistics decision-making in contested and dynamic environments. Key applications include:   - Dynamic and Survivable Space Logistics: For USSF, AMC, Space Operations Command (SpOC), and SSC, enabling real-time resupply and routing under adversarial conditions.  - Mission Planning in Great Power Competition: Support logistics strategy and sustainment under threat conditions, denial-of-service environments, and complex global mobility scenarios.  - Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and Rapid Global Mobility: Enhance deployment timelines, asset utilization, and supply chain resilience across air and space domains.   The platform will also serve multiple high-demand commercial sectors facing complex, dynamic logistics challenges, including:  - Space Cargo and Orbital Routing: Enable predictive cargo planning for commercial spaceports, launch providers, and satellite resupply networks.  - Global Supply Chain Optimization: Serve aerospace, maritime, and automotive firms by improving cost-efficiency, resilience, and routing under uncertainty.  - AI-Quantum Logistics Tools: Provide a new class of logistics planning products that combine AI prediction with quantum optimization—ideal for logistics automation, risk forecasting, and multi-modal scheduling in large-scale networks.   The target Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is TRL 7, 8, or 9 achieved through successful operational prototype demonstration, integration into live mission environments, and commercial product adaptation.   For the transition strategy, consider a DoD transition path by working directly with SSC, USTRANSCOM, and logistics operators to embed the platform into operational workflows and digital twin environments and a commercialization path partnering with space logistics firms, global supply chain integrators, and quantum computing vendors to deploy the platform as a commercial software as a service (SaaS) or edge-integrated tool.

          "Topic Title": "Quantum for Space Logistics Demand Planning & Optimization",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to establish the technical feasibility of applying Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum Optimization (QO) to space logistics planning, demand forecasting, and mobility optimization. This effort will develop and benchmark a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for a representative logistics scenario, assessing performance improvements over classical models. The Phase I goal is to validate the potential of QML/QO to enhance decision speed, adaptability, and mission resilience in dynamic, contested environments—laying the foundation for a scalable platform to be developed in Phase II. This aligns with the U.S. Space Force (USSF) Mission Sustainment Strategy and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) objectives for digital logistics modernization and survivable supply chain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The Department of the Air Force (DAF) and USSF face escalating complexity in sustaining agile, resilient logistics across terrestrial, orbital, and emerging space environments. Existing logistics planning systems are overly manual, computationally limited, and poorly suited for dynamic, contested scenarios. As logistics demands expand to include rapid orbital resupply, lunar outposts, and interplanetary assets, there is an urgent need for advanced decision-support tools. Hybrid quantum-classical computing approaches—including QML and QO—have demonstrated early promise in tackling combinatorially complex logistics challenges, such as:   - Reducing compute time by orders of magnitude for vehicle routing problems (VRP), job scheduling, and inventory optimization.  - Enabling real-time planning adaptations under operational stressors and adversarial disruptions.   - Scaling across terrestrial, orbital, lunar, and interplanetary logistics architectures.   Core capability areas to be explored in this effort include:  1. Quantum-Enhanced Demand Forecasting: Leveraging QML to model operational and environmental data, enabling superior responsiveness in uncertain and fast-changing mission environments.  2. Hybrid Quantum Optimization for Routing & Scheduling: Applying quantum algorithms—such as quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) and quantum annealing—to solve NP-hard logistics problems and benchmarking them against classical methods.  3. Mission-Aware, Real-Time Logistics Planning: Integrating real-time data (e.g., weather, adversary actions, orbital mechanics) into optimization engines for continuous re-planning and mission adaptation.  4. Resilient, Contested Logistics Management: Modeling logistics risk under degraded conditions and exploring blockchain-enabled logistics chains for verifiability and control in adversarial domains.  5. Dual-Use and Digital Integration: Aligning with Logistics 4.0 transformation goals by enabling interoperability with DoD digital twins, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled mobility planning tools, and autonomous logistics systems.   Phase I will explore technical feasibility, prototype hybrid algorithmic models, and establish performance baselines. This effort directly supports the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy by advancing decision advantage, predictive planning, and mission survivability through next-generation logistics computing.   PHASE I: The objective for Phase I is to establish the technical feasibility and operational relevance of QML and QO for enhancing space logistics planning and demand forecasting. Phase I will focus on developing and evaluating a hybrid quantum-classical approach to solve logistics challenges such as dynamic routing, scheduling, or inventory management in space and contested terrestrial environments. Key tasks include:   - Develop a prototype algorithm or simulation that applies QML or QO techniques to a relevant logistics use case (e.g., vehicle routing, resupply scheduling, or demand forecasting).  - Construct a hybrid quantum-classical model, utilizing Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, classical decomposition strategies, and variational quantum algorithms where applicable.  - Benchmark the quantum-enabled solution against traditional classical optimization models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability under uncertainty.  - Engage logistics stakeholders (USSF, Space Systems Command (SSC), U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to validate use case relevance and gather mission-specific planning requirements.   Deliverables may include:  - A working prototype simulation or algorithm test case demonstrating the selected quantum technique.   - A comparative analysis report detailing performance trade-offs between quantum and classical approaches.   - A stakeholder engagement report summarizing feedback, mission alignment, and integration opportunities.   - A Phase II roadmap outlining pathways for algorithm maturation, scalability improvements, and field validation in real-world operational environments.    PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional, scalable quantum-enhanced logistics optimization platform using QML and QO. This system will integrate with operational logistics architectures from USSF, U.S. Air Force (USAF), and USTRANSCOM to enable real-time, resilient, and predictive decision-making for space and terrestrial sustainment operations. Key focus areas include:   - Platform Development: Build a full-stack hybrid quantum-classical optimization engine, leveraging QUBO formulations, quantum annealing, and/or variational quantum algorithms to solve NP-hard logistics problems at scale.  - System Integration: Develop secure and interoperable APIs to connect the platform with existing DoD logistics systems, digital twin architectures, and planning tools (e.g., Spaceport Common Operating Picture, AI-based cargo management platforms).  - Operational Validation: Apply the platform to mission-relevant use cases such as dynamic routing and scheduling under degraded or adversarial conditions, real-time resupply logistics and campaign planning, and mobility as well as sustainment optimization across orbital, lunar, and terrestrial nodes.   - Human-Machine Interface: Design an intuitive user interface for planners, analysts, and logisticians, enabling transparent interaction with quantum-driven outputs.  - Performance Benchmarking: Conduct comparative analysis of platform performance versus classical optimization solutions in representative mission environments.   Deliverables may include:  - A scalable QML/QO optimization prototype with web or edge deployment capability.  - Integration interfaces (APIs) for real-time data exchange with DoD systems and digital twins.   - Operational test results and benchmarking report, demonstrating improvements in speed, accuracy, and mission adaptability.   - A detailed Phase III transition plan, outlining technical, programmatic, and commercial pathways for full deployment.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III, the quantum-enabled logistics optimization platform will support high-priority defense missions requiring resilient, adaptive, and real-time logistics decision-making in contested and dynamic environments. Key applications include:   - Dynamic and Survivable Space Logistics: For USSF, AMC, Space Operations Command (SpOC), and SSC, enabling real-time resupply and routing under adversarial conditions.  - Mission Planning in Great Power Competition: Support logistics strategy and sustainment under threat conditions, denial-of-service environments, and complex global mobility scenarios.  - Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and Rapid Global Mobility: Enhance deployment timelines, asset utilization, and supply chain resilience across air and space domains.   The platform will also serve multiple high-demand commercial sectors facing complex, dynamic logistics challenges, including:  - Space Cargo and Orbital Routing: Enable predictive cargo planning for commercial spaceports, launch providers, and satellite resupply networks.  - Global Supply Chain Optimization: Serve aerospace, maritime, and automotive firms by improving cost-efficiency, resilience, and routing under uncertainty.  - AI-Quantum Logistics Tools: Provide a new class of logistics planning products that combine AI prediction with quantum optimization—ideal for logistics automation, risk forecasting, and multi-modal scheduling in large-scale networks.   The target Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is TRL 7, 8, or 9 achieved through successful operational prototype demonstration, integration into live mission environments, and commercial product adaptation.   For the transition strategy, consider a DoD transition path by working directly with SSC, USTRANSCOM, and logistics operators to embed the platform into operational workflows and digital twin environments and a commercialization path partnering with space logistics firms, global supply chain integrators, and quantum computing vendors to deploy the platform as a commercial software as a service (SaaS) or edge-integrated tool.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate a reusable, rapid-turnaround test platform capable of evaluating the behavior, survivability, and environmental response of various equipment, supplies, and materials under actual spacelift conditions—including launch, suborbital flight, microgravity exposure, and recovery. The platform should support high-fidelity data collection to enable empirical cargo qualification, with applications across defense, commercial, and academic logistics integration.   DESCRIPTION: This effort will close a critical gap between theoretical Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based cargo prioritization tools and the physical behavior of various supplies, materials, and equipment payloads during launch, flight, and reentry. As the U.S. government and commercial space industry continue to evolve logistics and supply chain concepts for orbital and suborbital operations, a critical capability gap remains: there is no standard platform for empirically testing how various commercial and industrial goods behave under actual spacelift conditions. Current qualification methods rely heavily on ground-based simulations, which cannot fully replicate the combined effects of launch, microgravity, reentry, and recovery. Without real-world test data, cargo survivability and mission reliability remain uncertain—particularly for next-generation logistics missions envisioned by the U.S. Space Force (USSF).   This topic seeks to develop a reusable, rapidly deployable test platform that can deliver modular payloads into suborbital trajectories to simulate relevant spaceflight conditions. The system should support the collection of high-fidelity environmental and structural data throughout the flight profile, including acceleration, shock, temperature, and pressure variations. The envisioned testbed should be capable of:   - Supporting payload exposure to microgravity and low-G environments;  - Executing high-precision recovery at designated landing sites;  - Enabling modular payload integration for various types of cargo and Classes of Supply;  - Operating from multiple locations with minimal launch infrastructure;  - Completing flight and recovery cycles within 48 hours to support high-tempo testing;  - Supporting unpowered or passive recovery modes, as applicable;  - Enabling repeatable, scalable test campaigns without requiring major platform refurbishment.   This effort will enable the physical validation of cargo behavior, complementing digital modeling and AI-based prioritization tools. The resulting capability will inform packaging design, handling procedures, and cargo certification pathways for both U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial logistics operations, contributing to mission readiness, energy efficiency, and reduced risk across the space supply chain.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The goal of Phase II is to design, build, and demonstrate a flight-ready, reusable launch and recovery platform that can evaluate the physical behavior, survivability, and environmental response of various supplies, materials, and equipment during suborbital spacelift conditions. The platform should enable modular payload integration and collect high-resolution environmental data across the entire flight profile, including launch, microgravity exposure, and recovery. The effort will culminate in at least one end-to-end suborbital test flight, including launch, flight, landing, and data collection. The demonstration should reflect operationally relevant logistics conditions and support data collection to inform cargo certification, packaging design, and supply chain integration. Key objectives include:   - Develop a modular test platform capable of reaching suborbital altitudes (120+ km) and supporting high-precision recovery;  - Integrate instrumented payload bays with the ability to capture data on shock, vibration, temperature, acceleration, and structural effects;  - Demonstrate the platform’s ability to accommodate a range of commercial and DoD cargo types;  - Validate rapid turnaround capability, supporting repeatable test campaigns with 48-hour or less recovery-to-relaunch timelines;  - Generate empirical test data to support refinement of cargo preparation standards and inform operational logistics planning;  - Enable integration with future supply chain validation frameworks, including “Operational Energy for Space” efforts.   Expected deliverables include:   - A reusable, operational suborbital logistics test platform;  - A modular, secured payload bay adaptable to multiple cargo types;  - Flight-qualified instrumentation kits for high-fidelity environmental data capture;  - A comprehensive flight test report, including cargo survivability and readiness metrics;  - Documentation to support future system integration and logistics planning use cases;  - A transition plan outlining continued development and potential adoption within defense and commercial logistics sectors.   This Phase II effort will produce a working prototype that fills a critical logistics testing gap. By enabling rapid, reusable suborbital test flights, it provides a practical method for validating material and cargo performance in realistic spacelift conditions. The capability supports USSF’s objectives for Operational Energy, mission readiness, and energy-efficient logistics integration. Long-term, the platform can serve as a dual-use qualification tool for defense, aerospace, commercial, and academic applications.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The KARMEN platform will provide the DAF and broader DoD with a capability to empirically qualify cargo for spacelift missions through real-world suborbital testing. By collecting environmental and survivability data, the system will reduce the need for energy-intensive retests and prevent mission failures caused by unvalidated cargo. Key military transition opportunities include:   - Empirical test qualification of supplies, materials, and equipment for space-based logistics and forward deployment;  - Integration into Space Systems Command’s (SSC) operational supply chain modernization and sustainment workflows;  - Support for “Operational Energy for Space” by validating cargo handling, packaging, and deployment procedures that reduce propellant usage and increase mission efficiency;  - Establishment of a certification framework for cargo readiness that supports distributed operations and improves logistics resilience.   Commercial applications include:  - The reusable KARMEN platform offers substantial commercial value as a dual-use testbed for companies preparing terrestrial goods for space environments. It can serve as a low-cost, high-cadence launch and recovery system for:  - Aerospace, biotech, and defense firms seeking cargo qualification for orbital or suborbital delivery;  - Commercial entities supporting space tourism, research missions, or lunar logistics, where preflight validation of cargo is critical;  - STEM programs, academic research institutions, and early-stage startups looking to test materials, sensors, or systems in realistic launch conditions without the high costs of orbital missions.   KARMEN will serve as a bridge between ground-based cargo modeling and real-world launch behavior, supporting both DoD operational readiness and commercial space innovation. It will establish a reusable, scalable model for validating cargo across multiple sectors, while reinforcing energy efficiency and reducing risk across the space supply chain.   REFERENCES:   1.

Current methods rely on ground simulations, which fail to capture the combined effects of launch, microgravity, reentry, and recovery. Project KARMEN aims to fund the design, development, and demonstration of a reusable, rapidly deployable test platform that can fly modular payloads on suborbital trajectories. The system must collect high-fidelity data on acceleration, shock, temperature, and pressure to enable empirical cargo qualification. This will directly support the U.S. Space Force's (USSF) need for resilient and reliable supply chains, inform packaging and handling standards, and enhance mission readiness. The platform is expected to have significant dual-use potential, serving commercial entities in the aerospace, biotech, and research sectors.",

          "Topic Title": "Project KARMEN: Rapid-Turnaround Spacelift Cargo Test Platform for Empirical Qualification",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate a reusable, rapid-turnaround test platform capable of evaluating the behavior, survivability, and environmental response of various equipment, supplies, and materials under actual spacelift conditions—including launch, suborbital flight, microgravity exposure, and recovery. The platform should support high-fidelity data collection to enable empirical cargo qualification, with applications across defense, commercial, and academic logistics integration.   DESCRIPTION: This effort will close a critical gap between theoretical Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based cargo prioritization tools and the physical behavior of various supplies, materials, and equipment payloads during launch, flight, and reentry. As the U.S. government and commercial space industry continue to evolve logistics and supply chain concepts for orbital and suborbital operations, a critical capability gap remains: there is no standard platform for empirically testing how various commercial and industrial goods behave under actual spacelift conditions. Current qualification methods rely heavily on ground-based simulations, which cannot fully replicate the combined effects of launch, microgravity, reentry, and recovery. Without real-world test data, cargo survivability and mission reliability remain uncertain—particularly for next-generation logistics missions envisioned by the U.S. Space Force (USSF).   This topic seeks to develop a reusable, rapidly deployable test platform that can deliver modular payloads into suborbital trajectories to simulate relevant spaceflight conditions. The system should support the collection of high-fidelity environmental and structural data throughout the flight profile, including acceleration, shock, temperature, and pressure variations. The envisioned testbed should be capable of:   - Supporting payload exposure to microgravity and low-G environments;  - Executing high-precision recovery at designated landing sites;  - Enabling modular payload integration for various types of cargo and Classes of Supply;  - Operating from multiple locations with minimal launch infrastructure;  - Completing flight and recovery cycles within 48 hours to support high-tempo testing;  - Supporting unpowered or passive recovery modes, as applicable;  - Enabling repeatable, scalable test campaigns without requiring major platform refurbishment.   This effort will enable the physical validation of cargo behavior, complementing digital modeling and AI-based prioritization tools. The resulting capability will inform packaging design, handling procedures, and cargo certification pathways for both U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial logistics operations, contributing to mission readiness, energy efficiency, and reduced risk across the space supply chain.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The goal of Phase II is to design, build, and demonstrate a flight-ready, reusable launch and recovery platform that can evaluate the physical behavior, survivability, and environmental response of various supplies, materials, and equipment during suborbital spacelift conditions. The platform should enable modular payload integration and collect high-resolution environmental data across the entire flight profile, including launch, microgravity exposure, and recovery. The effort will culminate in at least one end-to-end suborbital test flight, including launch, flight, landing, and data collection. The demonstration should reflect operationally relevant logistics conditions and support data collection to inform cargo certification, packaging design, and supply chain integration. Key objectives include:   - Develop a modular test platform capable of reaching suborbital altitudes (120+ km) and supporting high-precision recovery;  - Integrate instrumented payload bays with the ability to capture data on shock, vibration, temperature, acceleration, and structural effects;  - Demonstrate the platform’s ability to accommodate a range of commercial and DoD cargo types;  - Validate rapid turnaround capability, supporting repeatable test campaigns with 48-hour or less recovery-to-relaunch timelines;  - Generate empirical test data to support refinement of cargo preparation standards and inform operational logistics planning;  - Enable integration with future supply chain validation frameworks, including “Operational Energy for Space” efforts.   Expected deliverables include:   - A reusable, operational suborbital logistics test platform;  - A modular, secured payload bay adaptable to multiple cargo types;  - Flight-qualified instrumentation kits for high-fidelity environmental data capture;  - A comprehensive flight test report, including cargo survivability and readiness metrics;  - Documentation to support future system integration and logistics planning use cases;  - A transition plan outlining continued development and potential adoption within defense and commercial logistics sectors.   This Phase II effort will produce a working prototype that fills a critical logistics testing gap. By enabling rapid, reusable suborbital test flights, it provides a practical method for validating material and cargo performance in realistic spacelift conditions. The capability supports USSF’s objectives for Operational Energy, mission readiness, and energy-efficient logistics integration. Long-term, the platform can serve as a dual-use qualification tool for defense, aerospace, commercial, and academic applications.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The KARMEN platform will provide the DAF and broader DoD with a capability to empirically qualify cargo for spacelift missions through real-world suborbital testing. By collecting environmental and survivability data, the system will reduce the need for energy-intensive retests and prevent mission failures caused by unvalidated cargo. Key military transition opportunities include:   - Empirical test qualification of supplies, materials, and equipment for space-based logistics and forward deployment;  - Integration into Space Systems Command’s (SSC) operational supply chain modernization and sustainment workflows;  - Support for “Operational Energy for Space” by validating cargo handling, packaging, and deployment procedures that reduce propellant usage and increase mission efficiency;  - Establishment of a certification framework for cargo readiness that supports distributed operations and improves logistics resilience.   Commercial applications include:  - The reusable KARMEN platform offers substantial commercial value as a dual-use testbed for companies preparing terrestrial goods for space environments. It can serve as a low-cost, high-cadence launch and recovery system for:  - Aerospace, biotech, and defense firms seeking cargo qualification for orbital or suborbital delivery;  - Commercial entities supporting space tourism, research missions, or lunar logistics, where preflight validation of cargo is critical;  - STEM programs, academic research institutions, and early-stage startups looking to test materials, sensors, or systems in realistic launch conditions without the high costs of orbital missions.   KARMEN will serve as a bridge between ground-based cargo modeling and real-world launch behavior, supporting both DoD operational readiness and commercial space innovation. It will establish a reusable, scalable model for validating cargo across multiple sectors, while reinforcing energy efficiency and reducing risk across the space supply chain.   REFERENCES:   1.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate a reusable, rapid-turnaround test platform capable of evaluating the behavior, survivability, and environmental response of various equipment, supplies, and materials under actual spacelift conditions—including launch, suborbital flight, microgravity exposure, and recovery. The platform should support high-fidelity data collection to enable empirical cargo qualification, with applications across defense, commercial, and academic logistics integration.   DESCRIPTION: This effort will close a critical gap between theoretical Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based cargo prioritization tools and the physical behavior of various supplies, materials, and equipment payloads during launch, flight, and reentry. As the U.S. government and commercial space industry continue to evolve logistics and supply chain concepts for orbital and suborbital operations, a critical capability gap remains: there is no standard platform for empirically testing how various commercial and industrial goods behave under actual spacelift conditions. Current qualification methods rely heavily on ground-based simulations, which cannot fully replicate the combined effects of launch, microgravity, reentry, and recovery. Without real-world test data, cargo survivability and mission reliability remain uncertain—particularly for next-generation logistics missions envisioned by the U.S. Space Force (USSF).   This topic seeks to develop a reusable, rapidly deployable test platform that can deliver modular payloads into suborbital trajectories to simulate relevant spaceflight conditions. The system should support the collection of high-fidelity environmental and structural data throughout the flight profile, including acceleration, shock, temperature, and pressure variations. The envisioned testbed should be capable of:   - Supporting payload exposure to microgravity and low-G environments;  - Executing high-precision recovery at designated landing sites;  - Enabling modular payload integration for various types of cargo and Classes of Supply;  - Operating from multiple locations with minimal launch infrastructure;  - Completing flight and recovery cycles within 48 hours to support high-tempo testing;  - Supporting unpowered or passive recovery modes, as applicable;  - Enabling repeatable, scalable test campaigns without requiring major platform refurbishment.   This effort will enable the physical validation of cargo behavior, complementing digital modeling and AI-based prioritization tools. The resulting capability will inform packaging design, handling procedures, and cargo certification pathways for both U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial logistics operations, contributing to mission readiness, energy efficiency, and reduced risk across the space supply chain.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The goal of Phase II is to design, build, and demonstrate a flight-ready, reusable launch and recovery platform that can evaluate the physical behavior, survivability, and environmental response of various supplies, materials, and equipment during suborbital spacelift conditions. The platform should enable modular payload integration and collect high-resolution environmental data across the entire flight profile, including launch, microgravity exposure, and recovery. The effort will culminate in at least one end-to-end suborbital test flight, including launch, flight, landing, and data collection. The demonstration should reflect operationally relevant logistics conditions and support data collection to inform cargo certification, packaging design, and supply chain integration. Key objectives include:   - Develop a modular test platform capable of reaching suborbital altitudes (120+ km) and supporting high-precision recovery;  - Integrate instrumented payload bays with the ability to capture data on shock, vibration, temperature, acceleration, and structural effects;  - Demonstrate the platform’s ability to accommodate a range of commercial and DoD cargo types;  - Validate rapid turnaround capability, supporting repeatable test campaigns with 48-hour or less recovery-to-relaunch timelines;  - Generate empirical test data to support refinement of cargo preparation standards and inform operational logistics planning;  - Enable integration with future supply chain validation frameworks, including “Operational Energy for Space” efforts.   Expected deliverables include:   - A reusable, operational suborbital logistics test platform;  - A modular, secured payload bay adaptable to multiple cargo types;  - Flight-qualified instrumentation kits for high-fidelity environmental data capture;  - A comprehensive flight test report, including cargo survivability and readiness metrics;  - Documentation to support future system integration and logistics planning use cases;  - A transition plan outlining continued development and potential adoption within defense and commercial logistics sectors.   This Phase II effort will produce a working prototype that fills a critical logistics testing gap. By enabling rapid, reusable suborbital test flights, it provides a practical method for validating material and cargo performance in realistic spacelift conditions. The capability supports USSF’s objectives for Operational Energy, mission readiness, and energy-efficient logistics integration. Long-term, the platform can serve as a dual-use qualification tool for defense, aerospace, commercial, and academic applications.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The KARMEN platform will provide the DAF and broader DoD with a capability to empirically qualify cargo for spacelift missions through real-world suborbital testing. By collecting environmental and survivability data, the system will reduce the need for energy-intensive retests and prevent mission failures caused by unvalidated cargo. Key military transition opportunities include:   - Empirical test qualification of supplies, materials, and equipment for space-based logistics and forward deployment;  - Integration into Space Systems Command’s (SSC) operational supply chain modernization and sustainment workflows;  - Support for “Operational Energy for Space” by validating cargo handling, packaging, and deployment procedures that reduce propellant usage and increase mission efficiency;  - Establishment of a certification framework for cargo readiness that supports distributed operations and improves logistics resilience.   Commercial applications include:  - The reusable KARMEN platform offers substantial commercial value as a dual-use testbed for companies preparing terrestrial goods for space environments. It can serve as a low-cost, high-cadence launch and recovery system for:  - Aerospace, biotech, and defense firms seeking cargo qualification for orbital or suborbital delivery;  - Commercial entities supporting space tourism, research missions, or lunar logistics, where preflight validation of cargo is critical;  - STEM programs, academic research institutions, and early-stage startups looking to test materials, sensors, or systems in realistic launch conditions without the high costs of orbital missions.   KARMEN will serve as a bridge between ground-based cargo modeling and real-world launch behavior, supporting both DoD operational readiness and commercial space innovation. It will establish a reusable, scalable model for validating cargo across multiple sectors, while reinforcing energy efficiency and reducing risk across the space supply chain.   REFERENCES:   1.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin platform to support space cargo deployment planning, simulation, and decision support for U.S. Space Force (USSF) logistics operations. The system—referred to as the Virtual Space Cargo Deployment Function (VS-CDF)—should enable mission planners to model, visualize, and optimize cargo movements across the full deployment lifecycle. Key capabilities include pre-mission scenario modeling, intelligent configuration of cargo based on vehicle, mission, and environmental constraints, and dynamic simulation of real-time logistics events and contingencies. The solution should support integration with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) logistics, mobility, and space operations systems to improve agility, reduce mission risk, and enhance sustainment readiness in multi-domain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The USSF requires advanced tools to plan, simulate, and execute logistics missions in the space domain. Current logistics modeling and planning systems are primarily designed for terrestrial operations and do not adequately account for the complexities of orbital mechanics, rapid launch events, intermodal cargo transfers, or the dynamic nature of space mobility. This limits planning agility, increases mission risk, and hinders the development of responsive and adaptive sustainment operations in line with Space Doctrine Publication 4-0 and the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   This topic seeks to develop a VS-CDF—a digital twin environment that enables real-time planning, simulation, optimization, and visualization of cargo deployment for space logistics. The VS-CDF should support both pre-mission and live mission phases, providing operational planners with AI-driven decision-support tools, immersive modeling capabilities, and integrated risk analytics. Key capabilities of the envisioned system may include:   - AI-based cargo optimization, considering constraints such as vehicle configuration, mass, power, volume, payload dynamics, and orbital conditions;  - Virtual mission planning and execution tools, enabling full-spectrum scenario modeling for rapid resupply, disaster response, and contingency operations;  - Digital twin visualization and intuitive user interfaces, including 3D modeling, augmented/virtual reality integration, and multi-modal human-machine interfaces (e.g., gesture, voice, touchscreen);  - Supply chain risk management and contingency simulation, to assess disruptions, prioritize routing, and inform cargo sequencing under degraded conditions;  - System interoperability and integration with DoD logistics networks and space operations systems, including the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture (COP) and Joint logistics nodes such as U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM),  Major Command (MAJCOM), and Field Command (FLDCOM).   The VS-CDF platform will enable more effective logistics decision-making for contested and distributed space operations, improving mission readiness, reducing deployment timelines, and enabling a shift toward predictive and energy-efficient sustainment practices.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential.

The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: Under this D2P2 effort, the awardee will develop and demonstrate a functional VS-CDF—a digital twin software environment designed to support end-to-end planning, simulation, and decision support for space cargo logistics. The system will serve as a planning and analytics platform for mission stakeholders across the USSF and joint logistics enterprise, enabling predictive modeling, AI-based optimization, immersive visualization, and integration with real-time operational data. The Phase II objectives include:   - Develop an operational prototype of the VS-CDF digital twin environment, capable of simulating and optimizing cargo deployment across multiple mission types and logistics scenarios;  - Implement AI-enabled tools for cargo configuration, route planning, mission timeline optimization, and contingency response;  - Enable collaborative mission planning, supporting multi-user interaction across Joint, Coalition, and interagency logistics teams;  - Validate system functionality using live or historically representative DoD logistics data, assessing system accuracy, adaptability, and decision impact under realistic operational conditions.   Expected deliverables include:  - A fully functional prototype of the VS-CDF system, integrated with representative DoD logistics networks and space operations systems (e.g., USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM);  - Embedded AI models for cargo optimization, risk analysis, and scenario adaptation;  - Immersive visualization and user interface components, including 3D modeling, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) elements, or intuitive controls (as appropriate to the approach);  - A demonstration campaign conducted through logistics exercises, simulations, or wargames to assess mission utility;  - A final report documenting test results, user feedback, system performance metrics, and integration outcomes;  - A transition and commercialization roadmap outlining next steps for operational deployment and dual-use adoption.   The completed prototype will provide the USSF with a decision-support environment tailored to the unique challenges of space mobility and sustainment logistics. By enabling simulation-driven planning, risk-informed decision-making, and AI-powered optimization, the VS-CDF will enhance agility, readiness, and operational energy efficiency across both DoD and commercial logistics operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort will focus on transitioning the VS-CDF from a prototype to an operationally deployed capability supporting both military and commercial logistics ecosystems. The platform will serve as a decision support and simulation tool for complex, multi-domain cargo deployment planning—bridging the gap between terrestrial logistics systems and emerging space mobility operations. Military applications include:   - Provide a mission-ready logistics decision support environment for Space Systems Command (SSC), USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, and Joint logistics planners;  - Support operational planning and rapid deployment activities, including contingency logistics and distributed sustainment in contested domains;  - Integrate into training environments and exercise campaigns to enhance warfighter readiness and simulate space logistics missions under real-world constraints;  - Align with the USSF’s emphasis on sustainment agility, operational energy efficiency, and predictive supply chain planning.   Commercial applications include:  - Serve as a logistics optimization and simulation tool for aerospace, satellite launch, and space mobility companies managing commercial cargo operations;  - Enable advanced supply chain modeling and risk assessment for global logistics providers, intermodal transport planners, and commercial shipping networks;  - Support digital twin integration for defense contractors, airlines, and manufacturers seeking AI-based cargo planning and routing solutions;  - Extend to STEM education and academic research, offering a virtualized space logistics environment for training, experimentation, and collaboration.   For the transition plan, the DoD adoption will be pursued through coordination with SSC, USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, and FLDCOM for integration into operational planning tools and logistics networks. Commercial transition pathways will include partnerships with aerospace firms, logistics technology providers, and digital twin software vendors. The system will also be designed for interoperability with existing AI-based logistics tools, supporting scalable deployment across both DoD and private-sector operations.   The expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at Phase III Entry is TRL 8 or 9, following successful operational demonstration and validation.   REFERENCES:   1. U.S. Space Force. (2023, March).

          "Topic Title": "Virtual Space Cargo Deployment Function for AI-Driven Logistics Planning and Simulation",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin platform to support space cargo deployment planning, simulation, and decision support for U.S. Space Force (USSF) logistics operations. The system—referred to as the Virtual Space Cargo Deployment Function (VS-CDF)—should enable mission planners to model, visualize, and optimize cargo movements across the full deployment lifecycle. Key capabilities include pre-mission scenario modeling, intelligent configuration of cargo based on vehicle, mission, and environmental constraints, and dynamic simulation of real-time logistics events and contingencies. The solution should support integration with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) logistics, mobility, and space operations systems to improve agility, reduce mission risk, and enhance sustainment readiness in multi-domain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The USSF requires advanced tools to plan, simulate, and execute logistics missions in the space domain. Current logistics modeling and planning systems are primarily designed for terrestrial operations and do not adequately account for the complexities of orbital mechanics, rapid launch events, intermodal cargo transfers, or the dynamic nature of space mobility. This limits planning agility, increases mission risk, and hinders the development of responsive and adaptive sustainment operations in line with Space Doctrine Publication 4-0 and the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   This topic seeks to develop a VS-CDF—a digital twin environment that enables real-time planning, simulation, optimization, and visualization of cargo deployment for space logistics. The VS-CDF should support both pre-mission and live mission phases, providing operational planners with AI-driven decision-support tools, immersive modeling capabilities, and integrated risk analytics. Key capabilities of the envisioned system may include:   - AI-based cargo optimization, considering constraints such as vehicle configuration, mass, power, volume, payload dynamics, and orbital conditions;  - Virtual mission planning and execution tools, enabling full-spectrum scenario modeling for rapid resupply, disaster response, and contingency operations;  - Digital twin visualization and intuitive user interfaces, including 3D modeling, augmented/virtual reality integration, and multi-modal human-machine interfaces (e.g., gesture, voice, touchscreen);  - Supply chain risk management and contingency simulation, to assess disruptions, prioritize routing, and inform cargo sequencing under degraded conditions;  - System interoperability and integration with DoD logistics networks and space operations systems, including the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture (COP) and Joint logistics nodes such as U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM),  Major Command (MAJCOM), and Field Command (FLDCOM).   The VS-CDF platform will enable more effective logistics decision-making for contested and distributed space operations, improving mission readiness, reducing deployment timelines, and enabling a shift toward predictive and energy-efficient sustainment practices.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: Under this D2P2 effort, the awardee will develop and demonstrate a functional VS-CDF—a digital twin software environment designed to support end-to-end planning, simulation, and decision support for space cargo logistics. The system will serve as a planning and analytics platform for mission stakeholders across the USSF and joint logistics enterprise, enabling predictive modeling, AI-based optimization, immersive visualization, and integration with real-time operational data. The Phase II objectives include:   - Develop an operational prototype of the VS-CDF digital twin environment, capable of simulating and optimizing cargo deployment across multiple mission types and logistics scenarios;  - Implement AI-enabled tools for cargo configuration, route planning, mission timeline optimization, and contingency response;  - Enable collaborative mission planning, supporting multi-user interaction across Joint, Coalition, and interagency logistics teams;  - Validate system functionality using live or historically representative DoD logistics data, assessing system accuracy, adaptability, and decision impact under realistic operational conditions.   Expected deliverables include:  - A fully functional prototype of the VS-CDF system, integrated with representative DoD logistics networks and space operations systems (e.g., USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM);  - Embedded AI models for cargo optimization, risk analysis, and scenario adaptation;  - Immersive visualization and user interface components, including 3D modeling, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) elements, or intuitive controls (as appropriate to the approach);  - A demonstration campaign conducted through logistics exercises, simulations, or wargames to assess mission utility;  - A final report documenting test results, user feedback, system performance metrics, and integration outcomes;  - A transition and commercialization roadmap outlining next steps for operational deployment and dual-use adoption.   The completed prototype will provide the USSF with a decision-support environment tailored to the unique challenges of space mobility and sustainment logistics. By enabling simulation-driven planning, risk-informed decision-making, and AI-powered optimization, the VS-CDF will enhance agility, readiness, and operational energy efficiency across both DoD and commercial logistics operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort will focus on transitioning the VS-CDF from a prototype to an operationally deployed capability supporting both military and commercial logistics ecosystems. The platform will serve as a decision support and simulation tool for complex, multi-domain cargo deployment planning—bridging the gap between terrestrial logistics systems and emerging space mobility operations. Military applications include:   - Provide a mission-ready logistics decision support environment for Space Systems Command (SSC), USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, and Joint logistics planners;  - Support operational planning and rapid deployment activities, including contingency logistics and distributed sustainment in contested domains;  - Integrate into training environments and exercise campaigns to enhance warfighter readiness and simulate space logistics missions under real-world constraints;  - Align with the USSF’s emphasis on sustainment agility, operational energy efficiency, and predictive supply chain planning.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin platform to support space cargo deployment planning, simulation, and decision support for U.S. Space Force (USSF) logistics operations. The system—referred to as the Virtual Space Cargo Deployment Function (VS-CDF)—should enable mission planners to model, visualize, and optimize cargo movements across the full deployment lifecycle. Key capabilities include pre-mission scenario modeling, intelligent configuration of cargo based on vehicle, mission, and environmental constraints, and dynamic simulation of real-time logistics events and contingencies. The solution should support integration with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) logistics, mobility, and space operations systems to improve agility, reduce mission risk, and enhance sustainment readiness in multi-domain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The USSF requires advanced tools to plan, simulate, and execute logistics missions in the space domain. Current logistics modeling and planning systems are primarily designed for terrestrial operations and do not adequately account for the complexities of orbital mechanics, rapid launch events, intermodal cargo transfers, or the dynamic nature of space mobility. This limits planning agility, increases mission risk, and hinders the development of responsive and adaptive sustainment operations in line with Space Doctrine Publication 4-0 and the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   This topic seeks to develop a VS-CDF—a digital twin environment that enables real-time planning, simulation, optimization, and visualization of cargo deployment for space logistics. The VS-CDF should support both pre-mission and live mission phases, providing operational planners with AI-driven decision-support tools, immersive modeling capabilities, and integrated risk analytics. Key capabilities of the envisioned system may include:   - AI-based cargo optimization, considering constraints such as vehicle configuration, mass, power, volume, payload dynamics, and orbital conditions;  - Virtual mission planning and execution tools, enabling full-spectrum scenario modeling for rapid resupply, disaster response, and contingency operations;  - Digital twin visualization and intuitive user interfaces, including 3D modeling, augmented/virtual reality integration, and multi-modal human-machine interfaces (e.g., gesture, voice, touchscreen);  - Supply chain risk management and contingency simulation, to assess disruptions, prioritize routing, and inform cargo sequencing under degraded conditions;  - System interoperability and integration with DoD logistics networks and space operations systems, including the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture (COP) and Joint logistics nodes such as U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM),  Major Command (MAJCOM), and Field Command (FLDCOM).   The VS-CDF platform will enable more effective logistics decision-making for contested and distributed space operations, improving mission readiness, reducing deployment timelines, and enabling a shift toward predictive and energy-efficient sustainment practices.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: Under this D2P2 effort, the awardee will develop and demonstrate a functional VS-CDF—a digital twin software environment designed to support end-to-end planning, simulation, and decision support for space cargo logistics. The system will serve as a planning and analytics platform for mission stakeholders across the USSF and joint logistics enterprise, enabling predictive modeling, AI-based optimization, immersive visualization, and integration with real-time operational data. The Phase II objectives include:   - Develop an operational prototype of the VS-CDF digital twin environment, capable of simulating and optimizing cargo deployment across multiple mission types and logistics scenarios;  - Implement AI-enabled tools for cargo configuration, route planning, mission timeline optimization, and contingency response;  - Enable collaborative mission planning, supporting multi-user interaction across Joint, Coalition, and interagency logistics teams;  - Validate system functionality using live or historically representative DoD logistics data, assessing system accuracy, adaptability, and decision impact under realistic operational conditions.   Expected deliverables include:  - A fully functional prototype of the VS-CDF system, integrated with representative DoD logistics networks and space operations systems (e.g., USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM);  - Embedded AI models for cargo optimization, risk analysis, and scenario adaptation;  - Immersive visualization and user interface components, including 3D modeling, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) elements, or intuitive controls (as appropriate to the approach);  - A demonstration campaign conducted through logistics exercises, simulations, or wargames to assess mission utility;  - A final report documenting test results, user feedback, system performance metrics, and integration outcomes;  - A transition and commercialization roadmap outlining next steps for operational deployment and dual-use adoption.   The completed prototype will provide the USSF with a decision-support environment tailored to the unique challenges of space mobility and sustainment logistics. By enabling simulation-driven planning, risk-informed decision-making, and AI-powered optimization, the VS-CDF will enhance agility, readiness, and operational energy efficiency across both DoD and commercial logistics operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort will focus on transitioning the VS-CDF from a prototype to an operationally deployed capability supporting both military and commercial logistics ecosystems. The platform will serve as a decision support and simulation tool for complex, multi-domain cargo deployment planning—bridging the gap between terrestrial logistics systems and emerging space mobility operations. Military applications include:   - Provide a mission-ready logistics decision support environment for Space Systems Command (SSC), USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, and Joint logistics planners;  - Support operational planning and rapid deployment activities, including contingency logistics and distributed sustainment in contested domains;  - Integrate into training environments and exercise campaigns to enhance warfighter readiness and simulate space logistics missions under real-world constraints;  - Align with the USSF’s emphasis on sustainment agility, operational energy efficiency, and predictive supply chain planning.

This topic is offered in partnership with AFWERX.      This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Air Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the DAF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).      Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a DAF stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of DAF, national, and global constraints.      Additional information on OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas can be found at https://dod-critical-technology-area-roadmaps.zoiclabs.io/.      The AF SBIR/STTR Program follows the policies and practices of the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (3 May 2023): https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. Validate the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the DAF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the DAF need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.      Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:   Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the DAF need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

It is an 'Open Topic' solicitation, meaning it is agnostic to industry or technology domain, as long as the proposed solution aligns with one of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas or presents a compelling 'Blue Sky' capability. The core focus is on dual-use technologies where a non-defense commercial solution can be prototyped and transitioned to fill a DAF capability gap. The program emphasizes applied research and development over basic research.",
              "comprehensiveDescription": "This solicitation (AFX25E-PTCSO) invites small businesses to propose innovative solutions for the Department of the Air Force (DAF). It is a broad, open call for technologies that can be adapted from the commercial sector to create new or enhanced capabilities for the Air Force and Space Force. The primary objective is to bridge the gap between commercial innovation and defense needs, thereby scaling the defense industrial base. Proposals must demonstrate a clear 'product-mission fit' with a specific DAF stakeholder. The program is structured in phases: Phase I focuses on a feasibility study to validate the technical merit and the product-mission fit. Phase II involves developing, integrating, and demonstrating a prototype of the adapted solution. Successful projects may transition directly to Phase III for broader implementation and commercialization. The program allows for flexible contracting mechanisms, including traditional SBIR/STTR contracts and Other Transactions (OTs).",
              "targetAudience": "The primary audience is U.S.-based small businesses, particularly those with existing commercial or dual-use technologies ready for adaptation. This includes startups and established small companies in technology sectors aligned with DoD priorities. For STTR proposals, a partnership with a U.S.-based non-profit research institution is required.",
              "eligibilityRequirements": "Proposers must meet the eligibility criteria of the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR/STTR Policy Directive.

              "criticalSuccessFactors": "1. **Validated DAF Customer:** The single most important factor. A letter of support or memorandum from the DAF end-user is a significant competitive advantage. 2. **Strong Dual-Use Case:** A credible, existing commercial product or a clear path to one. 3. **Clear Technical Plan:** A well-defined plan for the Phase I feasibility study and a vision for the Phase II prototype. 4. **Qualified Team:** Expertise in both the technology and business/commercialization aspects.",
              "commonPitfalls": "- **Technology Push:** Proposing a solution in search of a problem, without a clear DAF customer.\n- **Basic Research Focus:** Proposing work that is too early-stage and not focused on applied R&D.\n- **Vague Transition Plan:** Failing to articulate a clear and believable path from prototype to operational use.\n- **Ignoring the Commercial Aspect:** Focusing solely on the military application without a strong commercial business case.",
              "timelineAndPreparation": "Begin customer discovery within the Air Force immediately. Network through AFWERX events, industry days, and professional contacts. Aim to have a DAF stakeholder and a defined problem statement weeks or months before the solicitation opens. The proposal writing phase itself will require several weeks of focused effort.",
              "teamComposition": "The ideal team combines deep technical expertise with business development and program management skills. The Principal Investigator (PI) should have a strong technical background. For STTR, the team must include a strong partnership with a research institution, with a clear division of labor."

This SBIR/STTR opportunity is 'open,' meaning it welcomes solutions from any technology domain, provided they align with specified OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas like AI, space, cyber, and advanced materials. The program's core objective is to rapidly transition dual-use technologies to solve specific Air Force capability gaps. \n\nKey capabilities required include an existing or near-market commercial product/solution and the agility to conduct a short-term feasibility study (Phase I) leading to a full-scale prototype demonstration (Phase II). The innovation potential lies not only in the technology itself but in its novel application to a military problem, with a focus on 'disruptive' and 'radical' solutions. The expected impact is the delivery of new capabilities to the warfighter and the expansion of the national defense industrial base.\n\nA critical requirement for success is a pre-established 'product-mission fit' with a clear DAF customer or stakeholder who can champion the project. Therefore, this opportunity is best suited for companies that have already engaged in customer discovery within the DAF or have a clear strategy to do so. This is a high-readiness indicator, as proposals with strong end-user support are significantly more competitive. For STTR proposals, a formal collaboration with a U.S. research institution is mandatory."

This topic is offered in partnership with AFWERX.      This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Air Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the DAF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).      Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a DAF stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.

          "synopsis": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Space Technology   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an expendable, low-cost release mechanism that is agnostic of cargo container providers and tailored specifically for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. As the U.S. Space Force explores rapid global mobility through suborbital or orbital reentry of materiel payloads, there is a growing need for modular, affordable systems that do not rely on the expensive, high-RAM (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability) release mechanisms designed for traditional aircraft platforms. This release mechanism must be compatible with various commercial and government-provided reentry containers and enable rapid, mission-specific payload integration—essentially serving as a plug-and-play solution for space cargo. Drawing parallels to AFRL’s AgilePod for ISR payloads, this innovation would empower materiel transport teams to quickly adapt payloads across missions without reengineering delivery systems for each use case. A standardized, low-cost release interface would reduce total lifecycle costs and increase operational agility for space-based materiel transport, ultimately supporting the Rocket Cargo objectives and enabling a more flexible, scalable approach to global reentry transport and sustainment.   DESCRIPTION: Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to support Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. This topic seeks to develop a low-cost, expendable release mechanism that is agnostic of cargo container provider. The objective is to broaden the industrial base and lower the cost of release mechanisms to the point they are considered expendable. This will enable faster payload integration and turnaround by allowing containerized payloads to be swapped in minutes, regardless of the mission type.   The concept draws parallels to AFRL’s AgilePod for ISR but is intended for any military payload, offering a “plug-and-play” capability across different container systems. This modularity would increase the range of missions supported by a single container platform and improve materiel transport agility. By creating a standardized release interface, the DAF can increase flexibility and reduce costs for reentry-capable space containers and delivery systems, directly supporting Rocket Cargo goals.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the D2P2 proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force and/or Space Force stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the DAF customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Air Force and/or Space Force need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Eligibility for a Direct to Phase Two (D2P2) is predicated on the offeror having performed a “Phase I-like” effort predominantly separate from the SBIR/STTR Programs. These efforts may include M&S, simulation of prototype concepts, cost benefit analysis, system-of-systems studies, experimentation and evaluation of operational imperatives to enable future concepts. Prototypes, M&S and experimentation should explore a wide range of integrating commercial capabilities to support the operational imperatives. These capabilities should consider areas that are unique to military operations, materiel transport, mission planning, mission execution, and base sustainment. A goal is for Phase II efforts to conduct sub-scale experiments and provide test articles for further test and demonstration. Experiments should address military-unique requirements that may not be otherwise met by commercial capabilities.   The Phase II objective is to advance the development of an expendable, low-cost, container-agnostic release mechanism for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. The goal is to deliver a standardized solution capable of supporting rapid payload integration across a broad range of military and commercial cargo containers. Eligibility for this D2P2 topic is based on the offeror having completed a “Phase I-like” effort independently of the SBIR/STTR program. This prior work must demonstrate technical feasibility and alignment with Department of the Air Force (DAF) operational imperatives.   Acceptable Prior Work Includes:  - Modeling & Simulation (M&S) of release concepts  - Prototype concept development and risk reduction  - Cost-benefit analysis or lifecycle cost modeling  - System-of-systems analysis of modular payload interfaces  - Field testing or lab experimentation validating separation mechanics or payload integration  - Evaluation of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) adaptation potential   Phase II Expectations:  - Conduct sub-scale experiments and prototype testing in simulated or relevant operational environments  - Deliver test articles suitable for additional government testing and demonstration  - Refine the design based on performance, manufacturability, and feedback from integration testing  - Ensure the solution meets DAF-specific requirements for modularity, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness  - Identify pathways to full-scale manufacturing and deployment   The end state is to enable rapid integration and separation of space payloads via a universal, low-cost release mechanism that supports Rocket Cargo materiel transport operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III shall include upgrades to the analysis, M&S, T&E results and provide mature prototypes of system concepts. Phase III shall provide a business plan and address the ability to transition technology and system concepts to commercial applications. The adapted non-Defense commercial solutions shall provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential Governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications. Integration and other technical support to operational users may be required.   The Phase III objective is to advance the Affordable Release Mechanism (ARM) from prototype to field-ready, flight-qualified technology through operational testing, system maturation, and commercial transition planning. Phase III efforts will focus on validating performance in operational-like environments, supporting integration with government platforms, and exploring broader commercial utility. Military Applications include:   - Rocket Cargo materiel transport for USSF and USAF missions  - Rapid launch and reentry materiel transport for agile space operations  - Standardized, modular release systems to support distributed space assets and cargo flexibility  - Reduced lifecycle and integration costs for DAF missions requiring payload reconfiguration   Commercial Applications include:  - Adaptable payload deployment systems for commercial launch vehicle operators  - Universal interfaces for containerized space materiel transport and return systems  - Broader use in aerospace, delivery systems, and reusable vehicle components   The end state is to transition the ARM system into both military and commercial use to support scalable, low-cost, container-agnostic payload release in dynamic, high-tempo space materiel transport environments. By enabling fast integration and deployment across diverse mission sets, ARM increases mission agility, platform interoperability, and operational efficiency for both government and industry stakeholders.

          "Topic Title": "Affordable Release Mechanism (ARM)",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Space Technology   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an expendable, low-cost release mechanism that is agnostic of cargo container providers and tailored specifically for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. As the U.S. Space Force explores rapid global mobility through suborbital or orbital reentry of materiel payloads, there is a growing need for modular, affordable systems that do not rely on the expensive, high-RAM (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability) release mechanisms designed for traditional aircraft platforms. This release mechanism must be compatible with various commercial and government-provided reentry containers and enable rapid, mission-specific payload integration—essentially serving as a plug-and-play solution for space cargo. Drawing parallels to AFRL’s AgilePod for ISR payloads, this innovation would empower materiel transport teams to quickly adapt payloads across missions without reengineering delivery systems for each use case. A standardized, low-cost release interface would reduce total lifecycle costs and increase operational agility for space-based materiel transport, ultimately supporting the Rocket Cargo objectives and enabling a more flexible, scalable approach to global reentry transport and sustainment.   DESCRIPTION: Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to support Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. This topic seeks to develop a low-cost, expendable release mechanism that is agnostic of cargo container provider. The objective is to broaden the industrial base and lower the cost of release mechanisms to the point they are considered expendable. This will enable faster payload integration and turnaround by allowing containerized payloads to be swapped in minutes, regardless of the mission type.   The concept draws parallels to AFRL’s AgilePod for ISR but is intended for any military payload, offering a “plug-and-play” capability across different container systems. This modularity would increase the range of missions supported by a single container platform and improve materiel transport agility. By creating a standardized release interface, the DAF can increase flexibility and reduce costs for reentry-capable space containers and delivery systems, directly supporting Rocket Cargo goals.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the D2P2 proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force and/or Space Force stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the DAF customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Air Force and/or Space Force need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Eligibility for a Direct to Phase Two (D2P2) is predicated on the offeror having performed a “Phase I-like” effort predominantly separate from the SBIR/STTR Programs. These efforts may include M&S, simulation of prototype concepts, cost benefit analysis, system-of-systems studies, experimentation and evaluation of operational imperatives to enable future concepts. Prototypes, M&S and experimentation should explore a wide range of integrating commercial capabilities to support the operational imperatives. These capabilities should consider areas that are unique to military operations, materiel transport, mission planning, mission execution, and base sustainment. A goal is for Phase II efforts to conduct sub-scale experiments and provide test articles for further test and demonstration. Experiments should address military-unique requirements that may not be otherwise met by commercial capabilities.   The Phase II objective is to advance the development of an expendable, low-cost, container-agnostic release mechanism for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. The goal is to deliver a standardized solution capable of supporting rapid payload integration across a broad range of military and commercial cargo containers. Eligibility for this D2P2 topic is based on the offeror having completed a “Phase I-like” effort independently of the SBIR/STTR program. This prior work must demonstrate technical feasibility and alignment with Department of the Air Force (DAF) operational imperatives.   Acceptable Prior Work Includes:  - Modeling & Simulation (M&S) of release concepts  - Prototype concept development and risk reduction  - Cost-benefit analysis or lifecycle cost modeling  - System-of-systems analysis of modular payload interfaces  - Field testing or lab experimentation validating separation mechanics or payload integration  - Evaluation of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) adaptation potential   Phase II Expectations:  - Conduct sub-scale experiments and prototype testing in simulated or relevant operational environments  - Deliver test articles suitable for additional government testing and demonstration  - Refine the design based on performance, manufacturability, and feedback from integration testing  - Ensure the solution meets DAF-specific requirements for modularity, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness  - Identify pathways to full-scale manufacturing and deployment   The end state is to enable rapid integration and separation of space payloads via a universal, low-cost release mechanism that supports Rocket Cargo materiel transport operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III shall include upgrades to the analysis, M&S, T&E results and provide mature prototypes of system concepts. Phase III shall provide a business plan and address the ability to transition technology and system concepts to commercial applications. The adapted non-Defense commercial solutions shall provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential Governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications. Integration and other technical support to operational users may be required.   The Phase III objective is to advance the Affordable Release Mechanism (ARM) from prototype to field-ready, flight-qualified technology through operational testing, system maturation, and commercial transition planning. Phase III efforts will focus on validating performance in operational-like environments, supporting integration with government platforms, and exploring broader commercial utility. Military Applications include:   - Rocket Cargo materiel transport for USSF and USAF missions  - Rapid launch and reentry materiel transport for agile space operations  - Standardized, modular release systems to support distributed space assets and cargo flexibility  - Reduced lifecycle and integration costs for DAF missions requiring payload reconfiguration   Commercial Applications include:  - Adaptable payload deployment systems for commercial launch vehicle operators  - Universal interfaces for containerized space materiel transport and return systems  - Broader use in aerospace, delivery systems, and reusable vehicle components   The end state is to transition the ARM system into both military and commercial use to support scalable, low-cost, container-agnostic payload release in dynamic, high-tempo space materiel transport environments. By enabling fast integration and deployment across diverse mission sets, ARM increases mission agility, platform interoperability, and operational efficiency for both government and industry stakeholders.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an expendable, low-cost release mechanism that is agnostic of cargo container providers and tailored specifically for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. As the U.S. Space Force explores rapid global mobility through suborbital or orbital reentry of materiel payloads, there is a growing need for modular, affordable systems that do not rely on the expensive, high-RAM (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability) release mechanisms designed for traditional aircraft platforms. This release mechanism must be compatible with various commercial and government-provided reentry containers and enable rapid, mission-specific payload integration—essentially serving as a plug-and-play solution for space cargo. Drawing parallels to AFRL’s AgilePod for ISR payloads, this innovation would empower materiel transport teams to quickly adapt payloads across missions without reengineering delivery systems for each use case. A standardized, low-cost release interface would reduce total lifecycle costs and increase operational agility for space-based materiel transport, ultimately supporting the Rocket Cargo objectives and enabling a more flexible, scalable approach to global reentry transport and sustainment.   DESCRIPTION: Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to support Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. This topic seeks to develop a low-cost, expendable release mechanism that is agnostic of cargo container provider. The objective is to broaden the industrial base and lower the cost of release mechanisms to the point they are considered expendable. This will enable faster payload integration and turnaround by allowing containerized payloads to be swapped in minutes, regardless of the mission type.   The concept draws parallels to AFRL’s AgilePod for ISR but is intended for any military payload, offering a “plug-and-play” capability across different container systems. This modularity would increase the range of missions supported by a single container platform and improve materiel transport agility. By creating a standardized release interface, the DAF can increase flexibility and reduce costs for reentry-capable space containers and delivery systems, directly supporting Rocket Cargo goals.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the D2P2 proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force and/or Space Force stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the DAF customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Air Force and/or Space Force need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Eligibility for a Direct to Phase Two (D2P2) is predicated on the offeror having performed a “Phase I-like” effort predominantly separate from the SBIR/STTR Programs. These efforts may include M&S, simulation of prototype concepts, cost benefit analysis, system-of-systems studies, experimentation and evaluation of operational imperatives to enable future concepts. Prototypes, M&S and experimentation should explore a wide range of integrating commercial capabilities to support the operational imperatives. These capabilities should consider areas that are unique to military operations, materiel transport, mission planning, mission execution, and base sustainment. A goal is for Phase II efforts to conduct sub-scale experiments and provide test articles for further test and demonstration. Experiments should address military-unique requirements that may not be otherwise met by commercial capabilities.   The Phase II objective is to advance the development of an expendable, low-cost, container-agnostic release mechanism for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. The goal is to deliver a standardized solution capable of supporting rapid payload integration across a broad range of military and commercial cargo containers. Eligibility for this D2P2 topic is based on the offeror having completed a “Phase I-like” effort independently of the SBIR/STTR program. This prior work must demonstrate technical feasibility and alignment with Department of the Air Force (DAF) operational imperatives.   Acceptable Prior Work Includes:  - Modeling & Simulation (M&S) of release concepts  - Prototype concept development and risk reduction  - Cost-benefit analysis or lifecycle cost modeling  - System-of-systems analysis of modular payload interfaces  - Field testing or lab experimentation validating separation mechanics or payload integration  - Evaluation of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) adaptation potential   Phase II Expectations:  - Conduct sub-scale experiments and prototype testing in simulated or relevant operational environments  - Deliver test articles suitable for additional government testing and demonstration  - Refine the design based on performance, manufacturability, and feedback from integration testing  - Ensure the solution meets DAF-specific requirements for modularity, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness  - Identify pathways to full-scale manufacturing and deployment   The end state is to enable rapid integration and separation of space payloads via a universal, low-cost release mechanism that supports Rocket Cargo materiel transport operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III shall include upgrades to the analysis, M&S, T&E results and provide mature prototypes of system concepts. Phase III shall provide a business plan and address the ability to transition technology and system concepts to commercial applications. The adapted non-Defense commercial solutions shall provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential Governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications. Integration and other technical support to operational users may be required.   The Phase III objective is to advance the Affordable Release Mechanism (ARM) from prototype to field-ready, flight-qualified technology through operational testing, system maturation, and commercial transition planning. Phase III efforts will focus on validating performance in operational-like environments, supporting integration with government platforms, and exploring broader commercial utility. Military Applications include:   - Rocket Cargo materiel transport for USSF and USAF missions  - Rapid launch and reentry materiel transport for agile space operations  - Standardized, modular release systems to support distributed space assets and cargo flexibility  - Reduced lifecycle and integration costs for DAF missions requiring payload reconfiguration   Commercial Applications include:  - Adaptable payload deployment systems for commercial launch vehicle operators  - Universal interfaces for containerized space materiel transport and return systems  - Broader use in aerospace, delivery systems, and reusable vehicle components   The end state is to transition the ARM system into both military and commercial use to support scalable, low-cost, container-agnostic payload release in dynamic, high-tempo space materiel transport environments. By enabling fast integration and deployment across diverse mission sets, ARM increases mission agility, platform interoperability, and operational efficiency for both government and industry stakeholders.

This topic is offered in partnership with SpaceWERX.       This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Space Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the USSF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).       Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Space Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a Space Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.  Additional information on the USSF Commercial Space Strategy can be found at https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.      Additionally, it is possible for a solution to provide a capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if an applicant feels its solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, it can reference the “BLUE SKY” category, including an explanation of the solution’s ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of Air Force, Space Force, national, and global constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas and USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of USSF, national, and global constraints.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Space Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the USSF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Space Force need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with USSF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.       Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:    Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the Space Force need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

            "programFocus": "This program, managed in partnership with SpaceWERX, is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) structured as an 'Open Topic' for the U.S. Space Force (USSF). Its primary focus is to identify and adapt existing or emerging commercial, non-defense technologies to solve specific USSF operational needs and capability gaps. The program prioritizes solutions with strong dual-use potential, meaning they have a viable commercial market in addition to their proposed defense application. A key requirement is for applicants to demonstrate a validated 'product-mission fit' with a specific USSF stakeholder.",
            "comprehensiveDescription": "This Department of the Air Force (DAF) funding opportunity seeks innovative, commercially-driven technology solutions for transition into the United States Space Force (USSF). It operates as an 'open' topic, meaning it is agnostic to specific technologies and problem areas, instead inviting companies to propose adaptations of their commercial products to meet USSF needs. The program is structured in multiple phases, starting with a Phase I feasibility study designed to validate the technical merit and, most importantly, the product-mission fit with a confirmed USSF stakeholder and end-user. Successful projects can then proceed to a Phase II for prototype development, integration, and demonstration. The ultimate goal is to scale these adapted solutions into the USSF and other government markets via Phase III contracts. Proposals must align with either the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas or the USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas. A 'BLUE SKY' category is available for truly transformative ideas that fall outside these predefined areas but offer significant strategic capability.",
            "targetAudience": "The primary target audience is U.S.-based for-profit small business concerns (SBCs). The program is open to both Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposals. STTR proposals require the small business to formally collaborate with a non-profit U.S. research institution. The ideal applicant is a company with a commercial technology or product that can be modified or adapted for a defense application, rather than one seeking funding for basic research.",
            "awardDetails": {
              "awardTypes": "The program utilizes a phased approach, likely awarding contracts or Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) for prototypes.

              "2. **USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas**: Space Domain Awareness (SDA), Satellite Communications (SATCOM), Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML), Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT), Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM), Cyberspace Operations, Command and Control (C2), Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)."
            ],
            "technicalPriorities": "The highest priority is not on a specific technology but on the **application and adaptation** of a commercial solution to a validated USSF need. Proposals must clearly identify the USSF stakeholder and the specific problem being solved. The technical approach should detail the pathway for integration into USSF operations, including development, regulatory navigation, and integration with existing systems. The 'BLUE SKY' option exists for disruptive capabilities that don't fit the listed areas.",
            "innovationExpectations": "Innovation is expected in the form of 'disruptive' and 'radical' applications of commercial technology to defense problems. The program seeks to leverage the rapid pace of commercial tech development. Innovation can be demonstrated by proposing a novel use case for an existing technology, a unique integration of multiple commercial systems, or an agile development process that significantly accelerates capability delivery to the warfighter.",
            "technologyReadinessLevels": "The program targets applied research and development, not basic research. This implies that technologies should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 3-4 at the start of Phase I. The goal of Phase II is to mature the technology to a prototype demonstrated in a relevant environment, typically TRL 6-7.",
            "interdisciplinaryCollaboration": "Strongly encouraged. Solutions often require a combination of disciplines, such as integrating AI/ML software (Advanced Computing) with sensor data (Integrated Sensing) for Space Domain Awareness (SDA). STTR proposals explicitly require collaboration between a small business and a research institution, formalizing this interdisciplinary approach."

            "programPositioning": "This opportunity is positioned within the Department of the Air Force's innovation ecosystem, specifically managed by SpaceWERX, the space-focused arm of AFWERX. It is a key mechanism for the U.S. Space Force to execute its Commercial Space Strategy and leverage the commercial industrial base to maintain technological superiority, as opposed to relying solely on traditional, government-led acquisition programs.",
            "nationalPriorities": "The program directly supports key national strategies, including the 2022 National Defense Strategy, the 2023 National Defense Science & Technology Strategy, and the USSF Commander’s Strategic Guidance. It aims to accelerate the adoption of critical technologies, enhance the resilience of the defense industrial base, and ensure the U.S. maintains its advantage in the space domain.",
            "partnershipRequirements": "Partnership is a fundamental requirement. Applicants **must** identify and engage with a specific USSF stakeholder (e.g., end-user, program office, requirements owner) to validate the need for their proposed solution. The Phase I feasibility study is built around confirming this product-mission fit. For STTR proposals, a formal partnership with a non-profit research institution is mandatory.",
            "internationalCollaboration": "This solicitation is limited to U.S. small businesses. International collaboration is generally not permitted under the SBIR/STTR program, and foreign ownership of the applicant company is subject to strict limitations.",
            "industryEngagement": "The program's entire premise is built on engaging the non-defense commercial sector. It seeks to 'pull' innovation from industry into the DoD by providing a streamlined pathway for companies with commercial products to enter the defense market. Success hinges on a company's ability to maintain a strong commercial business case alongside its defense application (dual-use)."

          "competitiveLandscape": {
            "competitionLevel": "Extremely high. AFWERX/SpaceWERX Open Topics are among the most competitive SBIR/STTR programs in the DoD. Success rates are often in the low double-digits or single-digits per cycle. The emphasis on customer validation means proposals without strong stakeholder buy-in are rarely selected.",
            "typicalAwardScale": "Projects are typically scoped for rapid feasibility assessment and prototyping. Phase I projects are small-scale studies. Phase II projects are significant prototype development efforts, often involving hardware/software integration and demonstration in a simulated or operational environment. These are not multi-year, large-scale basic research grants.",
            "reviewCriteria": "While the formal criteria are in the full solicitation, the synopsis implies the review will be based on three core pillars (standard for AFWERX/SpaceWERX):\n1.  **Defense Need:** The degree to which the proposal addresses a critical USSF need, backed by evidence of stakeholder interest (e.g., a customer memorandum).\n2.  **Technical Merit:** The feasibility and innovativeness of the proposed technical solution and the team's capability to execute.\n3.  **Commercialization Potential:** The strength of the dual-use case and the likelihood of achieving commercial success, which ensures the solution's long-term viability and affordability for the government.",
            "previousAwardPatterns": "Data on previous awards is not provided. However, analysis of public AFWERX/SpaceWERX award data typically shows a wide range of technologies being funded. A common pattern is that successful awardees have a clear, concise value proposition that directly maps their commercial product to a specific military problem, and they have done the 'customer discovery' work to get buy-in from a uniformed or government civilian end-user.",
            "strategicPositioningRecommendations": "To be competitive, applicants must shift their mindset from 'technology-push' to 'market-pull'. \n1.  **Lead with the Problem:** Frame the entire proposal around the USSF problem you are solving, not just your technology.\n2.  **Customer Discovery First:** Before writing the proposal, dedicate significant effort to identifying and building a relationship with a USSF stakeholder who can validate your proposed solution.\n3.  **Emphasize the 'Adaptation':** Clearly articulate how your existing commercial offering will be modified for the USSF, highlighting the speed and cost benefits of this approach over ground-up development.\n4.  **Build a Strong Dual-Use Case:** A robust commercialization plan is not an afterthought; it is a core evaluation criterion."
          },
          "applicationStrategy": {
            "keyProposalElements": "A successful proposal will likely require:\n1.  **Technical Volume:** A clear description of the technology, the proposed Phase I feasibility work plan, and the vision for Phase II prototyping.\n2.  **Customer Endorsement:** A Customer Memorandum (or equivalent document) signed by a relevant USSF stakeholder is the single most important element for demonstrating product-mission fit.\n3.  **Commercialization Plan:** A detailed plan outlining the commercial market, business model, and path to profitability outside of the SBIR/STTR contract.\n4.  **Presentation Slides:** A concise slide deck summarizing the problem, solution, team, and plan, as is common in AFWERX solicitations.",
            "criticalSuccessFactors": "1.  **Validated USSF Stakeholder:** Having a specific, named customer who has confirmed the need is paramount.\n2.  **Strong Dual-Use Case:** The technology must have a credible commercial market to ensure its long-term viability.\n3.  **Mature, Adaptable Technology:** The solution should be based on an existing commercial product or a technology mature enough for adaptation (TRL 3+), not a science project.\n4.  **Clear Integration Path:** The proposal must articulate a realistic plan for integrating the final prototype into USSF systems and operations.",
            "commonPitfalls": "- Submitting a generic proposal that is not tailored to a specific USSF need.\n- Failing to secure a customer memorandum or any form of stakeholder validation.\n- Proposing basic research (low TRL) instead of applied R&D.\n- Having a weak or unbelievable commercialization plan.\n- Overlooking security, legal, and contracting requirements for working with the DoD.",
            "timelineAndPreparation": "Applicants should begin the 'customer discovery' process 3-6 months before a solicitation is expected to be released. This involves networking, researching USSF organizations, and pitching the concept to potential stakeholders. The proposal writing period is typically intense, lasting 30-45 days once the BAA is open. Early and persistent engagement with the USSF is key.",
            "teamComposition": "The team should have a blend of technical and business expertise. The Principal Investigator (PI) must have the technical credibility to lead the R&D effort. The team must also include personnel with experience in business development, commercial sales, and preferably government contracting. For STTRs, the team must include the partner research institution, with a clear definition of roles and IP agreements."

The 'Open Topic' format allows companies to propose solutions across a wide range of areas, including specified OUSD(R&E) Critical Technologies (e.g., AI, Quantum, Advanced Materials) and USSF Mission Areas (e.g., Space Domain Awareness, SATCOM, C2). The core requirement is not just technical novelty, but a demonstrated 'product-mission fit' with a specific USSF stakeholder. Proposals must be for adapting existing or emerging commercial technologies, not for basic research. The program emphasizes a multi-phase approach, with a successful Phase I leading to a larger Phase II prototype development contract and a potential Phase III for acquisition and scaling. Ideal applicants are U.S. small businesses with a commercially viable product or technology who have already identified a USSF customer and can articulate a clear plan for both defense transition and commercial market growth.",

          "Topic Description": "OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas:   Advanced Computing and Software; Advanced Materials; Biotechnology; Directed Energy (DE); Energy Resilience; Future Generation Wireless Technology (FutureG); Human-Machine Interfaces; Hypersonics; Integrated Network Systems-of-Systems; Integrated Sensing and Cyber; Microelectronics; Quantum Science; Space Technology; Trusted AI and Autonomy      USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas:   Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)      Objectives:   This DAF topic seeks technologies for transition into the United States Space Force (USSF). This topic is offered in partnership with SpaceWERX.       This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Space Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the USSF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).       Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Space Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a Space Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.  Additional information on the USSF Commercial Space Strategy can be found at https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.      Additionally, it is possible for a solution to provide a capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if an applicant feels its solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, it can reference the “BLUE SKY” category, including an explanation of the solution’s ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of Air Force, Space Force, national, and global constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas and USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of USSF, national, and global constraints.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Space Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the USSF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Space Force need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with USSF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.       Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:    Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the Space Force need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.

This topic is offered in partnership with SpaceWERX.       This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Space Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the USSF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).       Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Space Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a Space Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.  Additional information on the USSF Commercial Space Strategy can be found at https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.      Additionally, it is possible for a solution to provide a capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if an applicant feels its solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, it can reference the “BLUE SKY” category, including an explanation of the solution’s ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of Air Force, Space Force, national, and global constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas and USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of USSF, national, and global constraints.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Space Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the USSF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Space Force need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with USSF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.       Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:    Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the Space Force need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

            "refinedTitle": "AFWERX Open Topic SBIR/STTR: Adapting Commercial Dual-Use Technologies for Air Force Needs (Phase I)",
            "programFocus": "This program, managed by the Department of the Air Force (DAF) in partnership with AFWERX, is an 'Open Topic' solicitation. It seeks to rapidly fund feasibility studies (Phase I) for adapting existing or emerging commercial technologies to solve pressing, but unspecified, Air Force problems. The core focus is on identifying a 'product-mission fit' between a commercial solution and a specific DAF stakeholder need, rather than funding basic research.",
            "comprehensiveDescription": "This solicitation (AFX255-PCSO1) invites small businesses to propose innovative, dual-purpose technologies that can be adapted to fulfill Air Force requirements, close capability gaps, or provide significant technological advancements. The program is intentionally 'open' or 'agnostic' regarding technology, industry, or problem domain, encouraging a wide range of applications. Proposals must align with one of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas or justify a 'BLUE SKY' approach. The program follows a phased structure. Phase I is a short-duration feasibility study to validate the technical concept and, most importantly, the product-mission fit with a defined Air Force customer. Successful Phase I projects can lead to a Phase II for prototype development, integration, and demonstration. A unique feature is the potential for projects to move directly from Phase I to a Phase III contract for procurement and fielding if the solution is mature and the fit is strong. The ultimate goal is to leverage the speed and innovation of the commercial sector to enhance Air Force capabilities and grow the defense industrial base.",
            "targetAudience": "U.S. small businesses (fewer than 500 employees) with a viable commercial product, service, or technology that has the potential for adaptation to a defense application. The program is ideal for agile companies capable of rapid prototyping and customer discovery. It is not intended for entities focused on basic research (TRL 1-2).",
            "eligibilityRequirements": "Applicants must meet the eligibility criteria of the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR/STTR Policy Directive. This includes being a for-profit U.S.-based company with 500 or fewer employees. For STTR proposals, the small business must partner with a U.S. non-profit research institution, with the small business performing at least 40% of the work and the research institution at least 30%.",

          },
          "technicalFocusAreas": {
            "primaryResearchDomains": "The solicitation is thematically open but requires alignment with one of the following OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas:\n- Advanced Computing and Software\n- Advanced Materials\n- Biotechnology\n- Directed Energy (DE)\n- Energy Resilience\n- Future Generation Wireless Technology (FutureG)\n- Human-Machine Interfaces\n- Hypersonics\n- Integrated Network Systems-of-Systems\n- Integrated Sensing and Cyber\n- Microelectronics\n- Quantum Science\n- Space Technology\n- Trusted AI and Autonomy\n- **BLUE SKY**: A catch-all for proposals with high strategic potential that do not fit the above categories.",
            "specificTechnicalRequirements": "The primary technical requirement is the adaptation of a non-defense commercial solution to meet a DAF need. The proposal must describe a clear pathway for this adaptation, including core technology development, integration with existing DAF systems, and navigation of relevant regulatory processes (e.g., cybersecurity, airworthiness). The focus is on applied R&D and prototyping, not basic science.",
            "innovationExpectations": "Innovation is expected in the novel application of commercial technology to solve a defense problem. The solicitation uses keywords like 'Disruptive' and 'Radical,' indicating an interest in solutions that can create new capabilities or fundamentally change how the Air Force operates. The innovation lies in the integration and adaptation, creating a dual-use product that is sustainable in both commercial and defense markets.",
            "technologyReadinessLevels": "Not explicitly stated. However, the focus on adapting 'commercial solutions' and moving quickly to prototypes suggests an expected starting TRL of 3-6. The program is not suitable for basic research (TRL 1-2). The goal of a Phase II is to advance the technology to a TRL of 6-7 (prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).",
            "interdisciplinaryCollaboration": "While not a formal requirement for the initial proposal, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for success. This includes collaboration between the small business and an Air Force end-user (the 'customer'). For development and transition, collaboration with systems integrators, prime contractors, and DAF entities responsible for sustainment, contracting, finance, and cybersecurity will be necessary."

The dual-use model strengthens the U.S. industrial base, another key strategic priority.",
            "partnershipOpportunities": "Partnership is the central pillar of this program. The primary required partnership is between the proposing small business and an Air Force 'customer' (stakeholder, end-user, TPOC). Identifying and cultivating this relationship is the main goal of Phase I and a prerequisite for Phase II. Secondary partnership opportunities exist with prime contractors for system integration, and with venture capital or private equity for scaling the commercial side of the business.",
            "internationalCollaboration": "International collaboration is generally not a focus of the SBIR/STTR programs due to their mandate to support U.S. small businesses. All work must be performed in the United States. Foreign nationals and components can be involved but are subject to strict review and regulations.",
            "industryEngagement": "Deep industry engagement is fundamental. The entire premise is to leverage commercial technology. Applicants must demonstrate a strong commercialization plan alongside their Air Force transition plan. The long-term viability of the proposed solution is judged on its ability to succeed in the commercial market, which ensures it remains state-of-the-art and sustainable without relying solely on government funding."
          },
          "competitiveLandscape": {
            "fundingCompetitionLevel": "Extremely high. AFWERX Open Topics are historically one of the most competitive SBIR programs in the DoD. The broad scope and relatively low barrier to entry for a Phase I proposal attract a very large number of applicants.",
            "successRates": "Specific success rates are not available. Anecdotally, the selection rate for Phase I is low (often single-digit percentages). The selection rate for Phase II is significantly higher for those who complete Phase I and secure a strong Customer Memorandum from a DAF stakeholder, as this is the primary filter.",
            "typicalAwardAmountsAndScales": "Projects start small with a Phase I feasibility study (~$75k-$150k) to validate the problem-solution fit. Successful projects scale significantly in Phase II (~$750k-$1.5M) for prototype development. The ultimate goal is a Phase III government procurement contract, which has no funding ceiling and can be a large-scale acquisition.",
            "reviewCriteriaAndEvaluationProcess": "While not explicitly listed, the evaluation criteria for an AFWERX Open Topic universally center on three pillars:\n1.  **Technical Merit:** Is the proposed solution sound and feasible?\n2.  **Team:** Does the team have the expertise to execute both the technical work and the business plan?\n3.  **Commercialization & Transition Potential:** Is there a credible dual-use business case? Critically, for Phase I, this is judged by the strength of the plan to find a product-mission fit. For Phase II, it is judged by the evidence of that fit (i.e., a Customer Memorandum).",
            "previousAwardExamplesAndPatterns": "No specific previous awards are listed. However, the pattern for successful AFWERX Open Topic awards involves companies that solve a specific, tangible problem for a particular Air Force unit or function. Examples from past cycles include AI-based predictive maintenance software, novel materials for runway repair, advanced VR/AR training systems for pilots and maintainers, and secure communication solutions.",
            "strategicPositioningRecommendations": "Do not submit a generic proposal based on technology alone. Success depends on customer discovery. Before applying, applicants should research potential Air Force problems their technology could solve. The proposal should be framed as a solution to a DAF problem. The Phase I effort should be presented as a plan to validate this problem-solution hypothesis with a specific DAF stakeholder. Leveraging networks, including those of military veterans or defense consultants, can be invaluable for identifying a receptive Air Force customer."
          },
          "applicationStrategy": {
            "keyProposalElements": "A Phase I proposal is typically a short slide deck or document that must concisely cover:\n- The DAF problem and the proposed solution.\n- The underlying commercial technology and its market traction.\n- The technical feasibility and the plan for the Phase I study.\n- The team's qualifications.\n- A clear and credible plan to identify and engage a DAF stakeholder/customer during Phase I.",
            "criticalSuccessFactors": "The single most critical success factor is demonstrating an understanding of and a pathway to securing an Air Force customer. A strong dual-use case, where commercial revenue can support and advance the technology, is also vital. The proposal must be clear, concise, and compelling, avoiding technical jargon where possible and focusing on the value proposition to the Air Force.",
            "commonPitfalls": "- **'Technology Push':** Proposing a technology without a clear problem to solve.\n- **Basic Research:** Proposing work that is too early-stage (TRL 1-2).\n- **Ignoring the Customer:** Failing to outline a credible plan for DAF stakeholder engagement.\n- **Weak Commercialization Plan:** Presenting a solution that appears entirely dependent on government funding.\n- **Vague Proposal:** Lack of specificity on the problem, solution, and Phase I plan of action.",
            "timelineAndPreparation": "Applicants should monitor the DSIP portal for the official Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) which will contain specific dates. Preparation should begin months in advance. This includes:\n- **Customer Discovery:** Researching DAF needs and attempting to network with potential end-users.\n- **Commercialization Strategy:** Refining the business plan and value proposition.\n- **Proposal Development:** Preparing the core content of the proposal well before the submission window opens.",
            "teamCompositionAndCollaboration": "The ideal team combines deep technical expertise with strong business and strategic acumen. The Principal Investigator (PI) should be technically credible. The team should also include personnel skilled in business development, commercial sales, and preferably, government contracting. For STTRs, a strong, integrated partnership with a research institution is key. For all proposals, demonstrating connections or a clear plan to connect with the DAF ecosystem is a significant advantage."

          "Topic Description": "OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas:   Advanced Computing and Software; Advanced Materials; Biotechnology; Directed Energy (DE); Energy Resilience; Future Generation Wireless Technology (FutureG); Human-Machine Interfaces; Hypersonics; Integrated Network Systems-of-Systems; Integrated Sensing and Cyber; Microelectronics; Quantum Science; Space Technology; Trusted AI and Autonomy      Objectives:   This Department of the Air Force (DAF) topic seeks technologies for transition into the United States Air Force (USAF). This topic is offered in partnership with AFWERX.      This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Air Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the DAF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).      Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a DAF stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of DAF, national, and global constraints.      Additional information on OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas can be found at https://dod-critical-technology-area-roadmaps.zoiclabs.io/.      The AF SBIR Program follows the policies and practices of the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (3 May 2023): https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. Validate the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the DAF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the DAF need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.      Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:   Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the DAF need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

This topic is offered in partnership with AFWERX.      This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Air Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the DAF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).      Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a DAF stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of DAF, national, and global constraints.      Additional information on OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas can be found at https://dod-critical-technology-area-roadmaps.zoiclabs.io/.      The AF SBIR Program follows the policies and practices of the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (3 May 2023): https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. Validate the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the DAF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the DAF need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.      Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:   Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the DAF need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.

          "Topic Title": "Phase I Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Space Force Stakeholder Need",
          "Topic Description": "OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas:   Advanced Computing and Software; Advanced Materials; Biotechnology; Directed Energy (DE); Energy Resilience; Future Generation Wireless Technology (FutureG); Human-Machine Interfaces; Hypersonics; Integrated Network Systems-of-Systems; Integrated Sensing and Cyber; Microelectronics; Quantum Science; Space Technology; Trusted AI and Autonomy      USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas:   Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)      Objectives:   This DAF topic seeks technologies for transition into the United States Space Force (USSF). This topic is offered in partnership with SpaceWERX.       This topic seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new Space Force solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling requirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements. The topic is seeking varying technical/scientific approaches and/or varying and new technologies for transition into the USSF. This topic may result in the award of prototype projects, which include not only commercially available technologies fueled by commercial or strategic investment, but also concept demonstrations, pilots, and agile development activities improving commercial technologies, existing Government-owned capabilities, or concepts for broad Defense applications. The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).       Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Space Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a Space Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.  Additional information on the USSF Commercial Space Strategy can be found at https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.      Additionally, it is possible for a solution to provide a capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if an applicant feels its solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, it can reference the “BLUE SKY” category, including an explanation of the solution’s ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of Air Force, Space Force, national, and global constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.      Proposals should identify which of the OUSD(R&E) Critical Technology Areas and USSF Commercial Space Strategy Mission Areas the proposed solution addresses or otherwise reference \"BLUE SKY\" and include an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of USSF, national, and global constraints.      Phase I:   Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Space Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the USSF customer, end-user, and TPOC.        The feasibility study should:   Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Space Force need(s).    Describe the pathway to integrating with USSF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other Department of Defense (DoD) or governmental customers.       Phase II:   Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.        These activities should focus specifically on:    Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results.    Describing, in detail, how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the Space Force need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale.    Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security.    Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.    Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or governmental customers for the solution.      Phase III Dual-Use Applications:   Some solutions may go from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition to the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.
