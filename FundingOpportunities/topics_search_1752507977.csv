Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an expendable low-cost separation system for space payload deployment agnostic of Launch Service Provider (LSP) and cargo container providers. The goal is to create concepts that prioritize affordability and sufficient reliability and quality without resorting to complex or specialized designs. Proposed solutions may include mechanical, electrical, explosive, or other innovative non-traditional methods, emphasizing simplicity and cost-effectiveness.   DESCRIPTION: This Phase I effort seeks to develop an expendable, low-cost separation system that is agnostic of Launch Service Providers (LSPs) and cargo container providers. The focus is on minimizing costs while ensuring sufficient reliability and quality without relying on complex or highly specialized designs. Proposed concepts may include mechanical, electrical, explosive, or other non-traditional methods. Emerging technological advancements provide a significant opportunity for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to enhance Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions through improved post-atmospheric reentry payload deployment. The production of separation systems is inherently complex and costly, with development traditionally limited to a small number of suppliers—restricting innovation and growth in the space industry. This initiative aims to shift away from costly, specialized designs toward innovative approaches in design, fabrication, and testing that support reliable payload survivability in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. The goal is to establish a versatile, expendable separation system compatible with any LSP and cargo container, broadening application across multiple space platforms and reducing the overall expense of payload deployment. Concepts should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and adequate reliability.   PHASE I: The objective of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost Separation System concept or conduct a comprehensive feasibility study assessing Separation System effectiveness relative to cost. This effort should explore innovative approaches that enable low cost, expendable, launch vehicle agnostic Separation System to enable survivability of payloads during atmospheric reentry, particularly for payload masses in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. Offerors should:   - Propose a clear technical approach for a Separation System or feasibility study of the Separation System performance with cost reduction.  - Include preliminary modeling, simulation, or experimental plans to evaluate Separation System characteristics.  - Identify key materials, fabrication methods, and production scalability considerations.  - Provide an initial assessment of manufacturing pathways and potential barriers to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  - Discuss potential risks and mitigation strategies related to Separation System performance, manufacturing, or cost.   Deliverables may include:  - A comprehensive feasibility study report detailing Separation System performance relative to cost.  - Conceptual designs or prototype descriptions illustrating the Separation System approach.  - Preliminary Separation System modeling or test data supporting performance claims.  - A manufacturing and fabrication pathway including material choices, production methods, and cost estimates.  - Identification of technical and production challenges, along with proposed solutions for Phase II development.   This Phase I effort will establish a foundational understanding and pathway for advancing the proposed Separation System solution toward LRIP and eventual operational use.   PHASE II: The Phase II effort will focus on advancing the research and development effort initiated in Phase I. The Phase II project aims at maturing the design and/or concept from the Phase I-like effort and possibly a prototype to conduct research and testing in lab and realistic environments to provide essential data to address any technical challenges, safety concerns, regulatory requirements, and/or other concerns. Awardee(s) should also identify any challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP).   The Phase II objective is to advance the development and maturation of the Separation System concept developed in Phase I. The goal is to create and demonstrate a prototype capable of meeting Separation System requirements for atmospheric reentry payloads in relevant operational environments, while addressing manufacturability, cost, and safety considerations.   Key Goals:  - Develop and refine Separation System designs or concepts based on Phase I findings.  - Fabricate a prototype system suitable for testing in laboratory and realistic operational conditions.  - Conduct rigorous testing to evaluate Separation System performance, structural integrity, durability, and compliance with safety and regulatory standards.  - Address technical challenges identified in Phase I, including material selection, fabrication methods, and integration strategies.  - Assess manufacturability and scalability to enable transition toward Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full-Rate Production (FRP).  - Identify and mitigate potential barriers to production, safety, and operational deployment.   Deliverables May Include:  - Detailed prototype design documentation and fabrication plans.  - Test plans and protocols for laboratory and operational environment evaluation.  - Comprehensive test reports documenting Separation System performance, safety, durability, and regulatory compliance.  - Updated risk assessment and mitigation strategies based on test results.  - Manufacturing and production feasibility studies, including cost analysis.  - Recommendations and pathways for LRIP and FRP phases, including any identified production or safety challenges.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort aims to demonstrate the separation system in an operational-like environment and achieve technology maturation and commercialization. The objective of Phase III is to demonstrate the expendable, low-cost separation system in an operational-like environment to achieve full technology maturation and enable commercialization. The effort will focus on validating system performance, reliability, and integration capabilities for both military and commercial space applications. Military applications:   - Provide the Department of the Air Force (DAF) and other DoD agencies with a reliable, cost-effective separation system compatible with multiple Launch Service Providers (LSPs) and cargo containers.  - Support Rocket Cargo materiel transport delivery missions, rapid deployment scenarios, and other space operations requiring expendable separation solutions.  - Enhance operational agility and reduce lifecycle costs associated with payload deployment and separation.  - Enable scalable production to meet increasing mission demands.

"Autonomous Modular Material Handling Equipment for Space Logistics Operations","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate a modular, autonomous or semi-autonomous material handling system capable of loading, transporting, and unloading heavy military cargo in support of expeditionary space logistics missions. The solution should be air- and space-transportable, compatible with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) cargo handling platforms, and capable of operating on both improved surfaces and austere terrain with minimal infrastructure. The system must be rugged, durable, and capable of supporting distributed operations in extreme environmental conditions while enhancing logistics agility, mission responsiveness, and safety in support of U.S. Space Force (USSF) sustainment objectives.   DESCRIPTION: Space logistics operations—including launch, landing, and transshipment—require material handling equipment (MHE) that can function in environments with little to no infrastructure. Traditional MHE platforms are not optimized for the unique mobility, durability, and transportability requirements of these missions, particularly in remote or contested locations where rapid deployment and turnaround are critical. To address this gap, the USSF and Space Systems Command (SSC) seek the development of a rugged, modular, and air-transportable MHE system capable of autonomously or semi-autonomously loading, moving, and unloading heavy military cargo. The system should support operations across a range of platforms and environments, enabling expeditionary sustainment for emerging space access and mobility missions. The solution should be capable of:   - Lifting and maneuvering standard cargo formats, including 463L pallets (up to 10,355 lbs.) and 20-foot ISO containers (up to 20,000 lbs.);   - Operating in austere terrain such as sand, mud, hills, and unprepared surfaces;  - Supporting multiple control modes: manual, joystick-operated, and autonomous;  - Being self-loadable/unloadable and air-transportable in C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft;  - Integrating with existing DoD cargo handling systems and container formats;  - Including sensor suites (e.g., cameras, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote control interfaces) to support operator safety and situational awareness;  - Withstanding harsh environmental conditions (e.g., electromagnetic interference (EMI) exposure, extreme temperatures, high humidity, corrosion-prone environments);  - Utilizing modular rollers, rails, and winches for flexible cargo control and rapid field maintenance.   Testing and demonstration of the prototype are anticipated at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (SFS) and/or Vandenberg Space Force Base (SFB) to validate the system’s performance under operationally realistic conditions. This topic seeks a Minimal Viable Solution (MVS) that delivers functional autonomy, transportability, and ruggedization while supporting distributed logistics, energy efficiency, and the sustainment posture outlined in the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: This Phase II effort aims to design, develop, and demonstrate a full-scale, modular material handling equipment (MHE) system capable of autonomously or semi-autonomously executing cargo loading, transport, and unloading operations in support of space logistics missions. The prototype should be tested under relevant environmental and operational conditions to validate its effectiveness in austere and infrastructure-limited environments such as spaceports, launchpads, and forward operating locations. This effort will emphasize system ruggedness, transportability, operational flexibility, and integration with current DoD logistics platforms, supporting rapid deployment and enhanced sustainment capabilities for the USSF. Expected capabilities include:   - Lift and maneuver standard 463L pallets and 20-ft ISO containers  - Operate autonomously or via manual/joystick control in austere terrain  - Self-load/unload into C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft  - Endure extreme environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, corrosion, EMI)  - Support modular maintenance and scalable upgrades  - Provide operator safety through integrated sensors and remote-control functionality   Deliverables may include:  - A fully functional, fieldable prototype of the MHE platform  - Integrated autonomy and control systems with multi-mode operations  - Technical data package including CAD files, system architecture, and interface control documentation   Testing reports documenting include:  - Maneuverability and terrain performance  - Environmental durability (e.g., thermal range, corrosion, EMI tolerance)  - Field demonstration at SSC, Cape Canaveral SFS, or Vandenberg SFB  - Integration roadmap for connecting with DoD cargo management platforms and logistics workflows   This Phase II effort should result in a prototype that is scalable, maintainable, and ready for operational assessment under realistic mission scenarios, ultimately supporting the goal of distributed, energy-efficient space logistics.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The developed material handling equipment (MHE) system is expected to transition into operational use across USSF, U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), and other DoD logistics units. Its ability to autonomously manage cargo movement in infrastructure-limited environments supports key mission areas such as:   - Expeditionary air and space logistics  - Launch and recovery site cargo handling  - Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and Distributed Operations  - Rapid transshipment at Space Mobility nodes   The Phase III system will enable secure, autonomous or semi-autonomous loading/unloading of critical assets at launchpads, forward operating locations, and contested logistics zones.

"Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Lasers (PCSEL) for Advanced Laser Systems","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials; Integrated Sensing and Cyber   OBJECTIVE: Develop and optimize designs for near-diffraction limited, near-infrared Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Lasers (PCSEL) laser diode arrays; a multi-element, surface-emitting, semiconductor laser structure with single-spatial-mode emission. Devices must output sufficient intensity to be used in various laser-based efforts for the U.S. Army, including solid state laser pumping and direct illumination across near-infrared wavelengths.   DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army uses lasers in many of its mission areas and would greatly benefit from a low cost, efficient laser source with high beam quality such as the PCSEL.  The Army uses Near Infrared (NIR) lasers, in conjunction with night vision goggles, during night operations for target pointing/marking, precision fires, and target handoff.  The NIR PCSEL can be developed to replace the existing edge emitter laser diode. The PCSEL device would be more compact, lighter weight, and less costly due to the PCSELs easy to manufacture planar structure, greatly improved beam quality, and reduced need for beam shaping and steering optics.   The Army also uses compact solid-state lasers in laser rangefinders, for target marking/handoff, designation, and threat detection. These lasers use doped glass or crystal that are pumped by edge-emitting laser diodes.  The edge-emitting lasers are highly asymmetric and highly divergent emission must be shaped by optical lenses in order to make it similar in profile to the round optical mode of the laser, as required to achieve good pump-mode overlap and high laser efficiency.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       This research effort will require the design and optimization and fabrication of proof-of-concept of NIR PCSELs for use in U.S. Army applications.  Develop PCSEL designs that meet program requirements as stated in the description portion of this topic, optimizing for beam quality. Results of modeling shall be provided as well as a manufacturing feasibility study. Metrics such as wavelength, power, duty cycle, efficiency, and beam quality should meet program objectives. Prior work in surface emitting laser diodes and photonic crystal meta-structures should be noted.   PHASE II: Fabricate and deliver >10 proof-of-concept PCSELs of several configurations (multiple near-infrared wavelengths and emitter areas) to validate model and allow selection of best design. These devices should demonstrate significantly improved (>10x) beam quality over existing commercial laser diodes. The packaging should allow them to be easily powered with existing laser diode drivers and integrated into a benchtop laser characterization system.

"Underwater Sensing in Surf Zone Environments","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI & Autonomy   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an underwater sensor optimized for size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) that can be mounted on a small uncrewed boat to detect bathymetry and underwater hazards in shallow, bubbly environments.​   DESCRIPTION: There is an increasing need to enable U.S. Army sustainment and maneuver support operations through littoral environments, including shallow-water and surfzone based landings, in potentially contested regions. In particular, enabling maritime operations and autonomous distribution to support logistics over the shore for the Joint Forces was recently identified as an S&T priority. In these over-the-shore operations, mapping bathymetry and shallow water hazards (e.g., unexploded ordinance) are of primary importance to ensure safe, efficient, and effective force projection. On exposed coasts, bubbles from breaking waves are a typical environmental impediment that attenuate acoustic signals denying adequate sensing, which leaves crewed or uncrewed systems with limited situational awareness in a particularly challenging environment, arguably the most critical portion of any transit.​   Surfzone bubbles range in sizes, depending on whether they are part of the alpha plume (initial injection) with sizes ranging from cm to tens of micros or the gamma plume (resident plume of smaller bubbles), the both of which creates attenuation of acoustic signals (Deane G. B., 1997, 1999). Leighton (2010) highlighted methods to classify bubbles and reduce their clutter using a Twin Inverted Pair Sonar (TWIPS) signal, motivated by signals used by dolphins. This was examined in boat wakes by Leighton (2011). Lee (2016) highlights bubble’s non-linear response as a potential method for discerning bubbles from hard targets. Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least). Geometries should consider usage mounting on small uncrewed surface vehicles.   Deliver a reporting document: (1) a computer-aided design (CAD) model of developed technology(s) (2) the experimental procedures and results that demonstrate the process meets the performance requirements; (3) the developed system. A favorable performance evaluation will lead into Phase III applications. All research, development, and prototype designs shall be documented with detailed descriptions and specifications of the composition, fabrication, microstructure, and mechanical performance of the prototype repair materials.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a strong commercial hydrographic survey industry that could benefit from this technology. Hydrographic surveys are required as part of every USACE Civil Works beach and navigation project nationally, and are used widely within the commercial dredging industry and maritime safety industries.  Presently, operation in the surf-zone is constrained to low or non-breaking wave conditions, meaning the ability to collect these data are significantly weather-constrained.         REFERENCES:    https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/102/5/2671/558076/Sound-generation-and-air-entrainment-by-breaking   https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/29/7/1520-0485_1999_029_1393_aepabs_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display   https://pubs.aip.org/as       KEYWORDS: Surf Zone; Autonomy; Landing; Acoustics; Bubbles; Sensing; Underwater Sensing; Acoustic Sensors    ",A254-046,BOTH,SBIR,DOD,ARMY,"August 20, 2025","July 2, 2025","July 2, 2025",https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/submissions/solicitation-documents/active-solicitations,Open,2025,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/12144

The edge-emitting lasers are highly asymmetric and highly divergent emission must be shaped by optical lenses in order to make it similar in profile to the round optical mode of the laser, as required to achieve good pump-mode overlap and high laser efficiency.  This requirement for shaping optics increases the overall cost and size of the laser.  In addition, edge emitting diodes are susceptible to optical damage by the laser emission and are very costly to fabricate because of the inherently complex manufacturing process requiring dicing of the wafer, facet coating, precise mounting of each chip on a heat-sink, and stacking multiple diode chips for high power arrays.   All of these deficiencies of the edge-emitting laser diode are overcome by the PCSEL:  first, the PCSEL structure is planar so that precise heat-sink mounting is not required, enabling low-cost fabrication. Second, its emission is highly collimated and symmetric so that it can be coupled directly into the doped glass without using any intermediate lenses required for beam shaping, thereby reducing laser complexity, cost, and size.  Third, because of its distributed emission area PCSELs are much less susceptible to optical damage, eliminating the need for optical filters that typically have to be placed between an edge emitting pump laser and the active laser glass or crystal.

"Autonomous Space Cargo Network (ASCN): AI-Driven Logistics Automation and Digital Twin Integration for Space Mobility","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to develop an Autonomous Space Cargo Network (ASCN) that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven automation, autonomous robotics, and digital twin technology to modernize and optimize cargo handling and logistics operations at the Space Joint Movement Complex (SJMC) and across the Department of Defense’s (DoD) space mobility enterprise. The ASCN will improve operational efficiency, accuracy, and resilience by enabling real-time cargo visibility, autonomous load planning, and adaptive logistics execution. This capability will form the foundation for a scalable, cybersecure, and interoperable logistics framework supporting space sustainment missions in both contested and commercial environments.   DESCRIPTION: The SJMC is envisioned as the central logistics hub for DoD space operations, supporting rapid deployment, sustainment, and agile mobility. Current cargo handling and logistics processes are heavily manual, lack real-time adaptability, and are not optimized for space-based supply chains or contested logistics environments. To address these gaps, the ASCN will deliver an integrated, AI-driven logistics automation platform designed to support the SJMC and broader DoD logistics operations. The ASCN will combine autonomous robotics, intelligent decision-support, and digital twin technology to enable full-spectrum cargo management—from warehouse to orbital interface—while increasing speed, precision, and resilience. Key capabilities include:   1. Autonomous Cargo Handling & Transport Optimization – This includes robotic forklifts and cargo handlers for autonomous loading/unloading, AI-based routing, prioritization, and adaptive logistics workflows, and seamless integration with space, air, and ground mobility operations.   2. AI-Driven Logistics Command & Control – This includes real-time AI controller for cargo flow, load planning, and schedule optimization, weight-based load verification and automated resupply workflows, integration with the Spaceport of the Future’s Common Operating Picture (SPOF COP).   3. Machine Learning for Mission Adaptability – This includes predictive analytics for storage allocation and resource positioning, dynamic mission reprioritization and automated contingency planning, and visibility and orchestration across all classes of supply.   4.

" Affordable Thermal Protection Solution (ARMREST)"," OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Space Technology   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to investigate novel innovative concepts of low-cost expendable exterior Thermal Protection Solutions or internal thermal management solutions for atmospheric reentry containers. The concepts should focus on low-cost solutions whether it be developing a new passive solution (or material) or taking existing products (like Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC)) and lowering the cost. The proposed concepts can include either passive systems, active cooling, or non-traditional options.   The intent is to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solutions (TPS) or internal thermal management concepts for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. The focus is on identifying and characterizing materials, configurations, or cooling methods—either novel or modified from existing systems (e.g., PICA, RCC)—that provide adequate thermal protection at significantly reduced cost. Phase I aims to validate the thermal performance-to-cost trade space through modeling, small-scale testing, or analytical studies. Proposed solutions should emphasize manufacturability, scalability, and suitability for protecting payloads in the 1–10 metric ton class. Passive, active, or hybrid approaches are welcome, provided they show a clear path to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and system integration potential in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions by enabling the ability to operate after atmospheric reentry. A key objective of this effort is to help advance and reshape the commercial external thermal protection solution and/or internal thermal management solution industrial base(s) from one focused on high performance and expensive thermal protection solutions that deliver small mass to one focused on good performance and lower costs that still enables survivability of the payload in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. This might require novel new approaches to the design, fabrication, and/or testing of the external thermal protection solution or multiple Thermal Protection Solutions. The DAF is seeking to avoid the cost and inflexibility created by developing specialty solutions for this regime. External protections can be expendable as long as the contents inside the containers survive.   The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is pursuing new opportunities for Rocket Cargo materiel transport that require payload survivability following atmospheric reentry—without the cost or complexity of human-rated Thermal Protection Systems (TPS). Current TPS technologies are often over-engineered and cost-prohibitive for cargo-class missions, particularly in the 1 to 10 metric ton payload range. This topic seeks innovative, low-cost, expendable external TPS or internal thermal management solutions for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. Solutions may include new passive materials, active cooling systems, or modified commercial off-the-shelf technologies such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) adapted for affordability.  The objective is to reshape the industrial base from one centered on exquisite performance to one optimized for cost-effective survivability of critical payloads. Proposed approaches should emphasize manufacturability, repeatability, and integration potential for materiel transport missions. Expendability is acceptable so long as the payload remains intact and functional post-reentry. Novel design, fabrication, and testing strategies are encouraged, especially those that reduce thermal protection cost without compromising safety or performance in realistic reentry environments.   PHASE I: This Phase I effort will demonstrate a concept for a low-cost Thermal Protection Solution idea or conduct a feasibility study that is capable of showing the thermal protection properties in relation to the cost. Awardee(s) should also identify a viable route to manufacture or fabricate their proposed solution and/or identify challenges to get to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) processes in Phase II. The objective of Phase I is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solution (TPS) or internal thermal management system designed for atmospheric reentry of space cargo containers. The focus should be on proving the thermal performance of the concept relative to its cost, particularly for non-human rated, 1–10 metric ton payloads used in Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. Offerors should:   - Explore novel materials, passive or active thermal mitigation strategies, or cost-effective adaptations of existing technologies such as PICA, RCC, ablative composites, or non-traditional materials.  - Demonstrate feasibility through modeling, material testing, or small-scale prototyping that shows survivability in high-heat flux environments typical of atmospheric reentry.  - Compare thermal performance against manufacturing and lifecycle cost considerations to support decision-making around affordability and scalability.  - Outline a pathway to Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) by identifying manufacturing routes, potential supply chain constraints, and design-for-manufacture considerations.   Deliverables may include:  - A concept feasibility report with supporting thermal and cost analysis  - Identification of candidate materials or designs for development  - Initial manufacturability assessment and LRIP transition strategy  - Recommendations for Phase II prototyping and validation testing   PHASE II: The Phase II effort will focus on advancing the research and the development effort initiated in Phase I. The Phase II project aims at maturing the design and/or concept from the Phase I-like effort and possibly a prototype to conduct research and testing in lab and realistic environments to provide essential data to address any technical challenges, safety concerns, regulatory requirements, and/or other concerns. Awardee(s) should also identify any challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP). The objective of Phase II is to mature and validate the low-cost thermal protection solution or internal thermal management concept developed in Phase I. This phase should focus on refining the design, fabricating a functional prototype, and conducting rigorous testing to evaluate performance in both laboratory and simulated reentry conditions. Key goals of Phase II include:   1. Engineering Development: Advance the design to a manufacturable and scalable prototype, incorporating insights from Phase I analysis and material characterization.  2. Testing and Evaluation: Perform high-fidelity thermal, structural, and environmental testing—such as arc-jet, plasma torch, or suborbital trajectory simulations—to validate thermal protection capabilities.  3. Integration Considerations: Evaluate the solution’s compatibility with atmospheric reentry containers and payload systems, including form factor, mass efficiency, and mounting techniques.  4. Cost and Production Analysis: Refine cost models, assess material sourcing and manufacturing techniques, and identify challenges for Full-Rate Production (FRP).  5. Risk Assessment: Address technical, safety, and regulatory considerations for transition to operational deployment.   Deliverables could include:  - A validated prototype of the TPS or thermal management system.  - Test reports detailing thermal performance, survivability, and compliance with mission requirements.  - A production readiness assessment, including updated cost analysis and supply chain risks.  - A Phase III transition plan outlining commercialization paths and integration into space materiel transport missions.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort aims to demonstrate the thermal protection solution in an operational-like environment and achieve technology maturation and commercialization. The Phase III effort aims to transition the thermal protection solution (TPS) into operational use through demonstration in relevant or operational-like environments, including suborbital or orbital reentry test flights. The primary goal is to achieve technology maturation, certification readiness, and commercial scalability. Military applications:   - Rocket Cargo materiel transport: Enable rapid, survivable transport of materiel through atmospheric reentry for Space Force and Air Force missions.  - Responsive Launch & Recovery Systems: Support reusable or single-use TPS for cargo return vehicles, drop pods, or reentry platforms.   Commercial Applications:  - Reusable Space materiel transport: Enable lower-cost thermal shielding for commercial reentry capsules transporting cargo from low Earth orbit (LEO), lunar, or cislunar domains.  - Rocket Cargo materiel transport: Advance solutions for materiel transport and express cargo sectors interested in rapid global delivery via suborbital reentry platforms.  - Space Tourism and In-Space Manufacturing: Provide cost-effective thermal solutions for non-crew critical missions in emerging space economy applications.   Transition Goals:  - Conduct one or more operational flight demonstrations using integrated TPS solution.  - Finalize qualification data to support DoD or commercial certification standards.  - Develop manufacturing and sustainment plans to scale for production and fleet deployment.  - Establish commercial partnerships with space materiel transport providers, defense primes, or space capsule manufacturers for integration.   This effort supports the broader objectives of the Rocket Cargo portfolio and contributes to building a resilient industrial base for affordable, non-human-rated thermal protection technologies.

"Project ASTROPAC: Intelligent Cargo Configuration and Deployment Planning for Enhanced Readiness","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled software tool to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment planning of U.S Department of Defense (DoD) cargo across a variety of container types. The solution must enhance agility, reduce packing time, and integrate maintenance and load planning actions while functioning in contested, disconnected, or coalition environments. It should support activity tracking, intelligent inventory mapping, and dynamic, on-the-fly reconfiguration based on real-time operational inputs. The system should allow user-friendly interaction through advanced Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), offer edge compute capabilities, and be adaptable to different user needs, cargo types, and mission constraints. The end goal is a scalable, dual-use tool that enhances mission readiness while also offering commercial logistics value.   DESCRIPTION: Space Logistics cargo operations—such as those involving Readiness Spares Packages (RSPs)—are vital to enabling the U.S. Space Force (USSF) to respond quickly to crises, contingencies, or emerging mission requirements. These operations rely on containerized systems (e.g., ISU-90s, 463L pallets, and custom bins or boxes) to preposition equipment, spares, and supplies. However, the current process for preparing and packing these systems is time-consuming, largely manual, and prone to errors, which limits readiness and agility. The USSF is seeking an innovative AI-enabled solution to optimize the packing, configuration, and deployment of cargo containers for movement to forward locations or spaceports. The desired tool should:   - Significantly reduce packing time and errors;  - Optimize spatial usage, weight distribution, and container selection;  - Provide real-time visibility into packing activity and container contents; and  - Integrate maintenance and load planning considerations into the cargo configuration process.   The system should ingest standard logistics data, such as National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and UTC (Unit Type Code) information from Major Command (MAJCOM) or Field Command (FLDCOM) sources, and output detailed container-level packing plans. It must support various container formats, be adaptable to different cargo profiles (including hazardous or classified items), and provide activity tracking and operational alerts to assist planners and personnel throughout the pack-out process. Solutions should prioritize user-centered design, enabling intuitive interaction through advanced HMI such as voice recognition, touch screens, or augment reality/virtual reality (AR/VR). The tool must be operable in contested or communications-degraded environments, offering edge-computing capabilities and the ability to sync with central systems when reconnected. This capability will directly enhance the USSF’s ability to execute rapid, distributed logistics operations with reduced cognitive burden on Airmen and Guardians. The topic is intended to stimulate innovative research and development (R&D) toward a dual-use solution with strong applicability in both defense and commercial logistics sectors   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Phase II goal is to develop and demonstrate a functional prototype system that addresses the USSF’s need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cargo packing and load planning for deployment and sustainment operations. The prototype should enable more rapid and accurate configuration of cargo across a range of container types and operational scenarios. It should support improved planning, activity tracking, and information flow in environments that may have limited communications or require flexibility for changing mission conditions. Phase II work is expected to include:   - Prototype Development: build a working software prototype that supports optimized planning and configuration of cargo. The system should accommodate various data inputs and packing constraints, including space, weight, timing, and priority of items.  - Operational Integration Context: demonstrate the prototype’s ability to support logistics personnel during cargo preparation and movement activities. This may include generating container-specific outputs, supporting real-time updates, or aligning with mission support functions such as maintenance scheduling or readiness tracking.  - Evaluation in Relevant Environment: develop a test plan and evaluate the prototype in an operationally representative setting. Capture performance metrics such as time reduction, accuracy of packing plans, user workload reduction, or adaptability to mission constraints.  - Transition Planning and Dual-Use Considerations: begin to define potential transition pathways, including DoD logistics operations and commercial applications. Consider compatibility with existing systems and outline next steps for operational deployment or commercial scaling.   Deliverables for Phase II may include:  - A functioning prototype software system;  - A technical report describing system capabilities, interfaces, and performance results;  - A summary of evaluation outcomes and user feedback;  - Documentation to support transition or further development;  - A commercialization and transition strategy aligned with potential military and commercial applications.   Phase II will deliver a validated prototype system that enables more efficient, informed, and agile cargo packing and planning. The solution should enhance operational readiness, reduce time and error in the packing process, and support integration with broader logistics and sustainment activities.   To facilitate the potential transition from Phase II to Phase III, a transition plan will be developed that outlines the steps necessary to ensure that the optimization solution is deployed and used effectively by government and commercial partners. The plan will include a timeline for deployment, a plan for identifying potential partners and customers, and a plan for marketing and selling the solution. The plan will also include a detailed description of the integration plan, and any necessary modifications or customizations needed to make the solution compatible with existing systems.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort for the RSP Optimization for Efficient Deployment SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization. The developed technology has dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. Military applications include RSP deployment and other supply chain management operations, as well as maintenance and load planning actions. The technology can help the military optimize its logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Commercial applications manufacturing, and distribution. The technology can help commercial organizations optimize their logistics operations, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.

The technology will have been tested and validated in realistic environments, and any necessary modifications or customizations will have been made to ensure that it is compatible with existing systems and workflows. Additional information regarding transition planning includes identifying known government approvals required for deployment and any additional opportunities for deployment of the optimization solution within the government and commercial sectors. The integration plan will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure that the optimization solution is integrated seamlessly into their existing systems and workflows.   Overall, the expected Phase III effort for the ASTROPAC SBIR topic is to transition the technology from development to full-scale production and commercialization, with dual-use applications for both military and commercial logistics operations. The expected TRL at Phase III entry will be TRL 8 or 9, and the transition planning will involve working closely with government and commercial partners to ensure seamless integration into existing systems and workflows.

"Real-Time Detection and Tracking of High-Velocity Atmospheric Transits","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Emerging Threat Reduction   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to develop a real-time hardware and/or software tool capable of detecting, tracking, and predicting the trajectory of high-speed objects transiting the upper atmosphere (200–400 km altitude) at suborbital or “space-capable” velocities. The system must automatically determine time, location, and vector data, and provide impact predictions for Earth-bound objects. The solution should integrate with existing Space Domain Awareness (SDA) toolchains and support automated alerting, data dissemination via public application interface (APIs), and contribution to the Unified Data Library (UDL).   DESCRIPTION: As space operations evolve and adversaries adopt non-traditional propulsion methods and exotic orbital behaviors, the need for enhanced SDA is increasingly critical. Emerging threats—including hypersonic glide vehicles, suborbital missiles, and high-altitude platforms such as surveillance balloons—pose a significant challenge to current detection and command-and-control systems. To address this capability gap, U.S. Space Force (USSF) Space Systems Command (SSC) SDA Tools, Applications, and Processing (TAP) Lab is seeking hardware and/or software-based solutions that can automatically and in real time detect, track, and predict the trajectory of objects transiting the upper atmosphere (200–400 km altitude) at space-capable velocities—defined as speeds above traditional aircraft but below orbital velocity. The proposed solution must:   - Detect time, location, and vector of objects in near real-time.   - Predict impact point and time for Earth-bound trajectories.   - Leverage data driven solutions such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) (other state of the art) that are capable of processing data at high rates (edge computing).   - Seamlessly integrate into SDA Tap Lab and USSF toolchains via secure APIs.   - Be capable of publishing data to the UDL and optionally via a public-facing API for broader operational use.   This request includes six key technical subtasks:   1. Ingest and process data from ionospheric, geomagnetic, or similar sensor sources.   2. Detect atmospheric disturbances indicative of object ingress/egress.   3. Localize events within the 200–400 km altitude range.   4. Correlate multiple detections into a single transiting object event.   5. Generate object tracks, including time, position, and velocity vector.   6. Predict the final location and time of impact.   Potential data sources may include:   - Ionospheric sensors (e.g., Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)),   - Geomagnetic sensors (e.g., United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geomagnetism Program),   - Web-accessible Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms.   Innovative techniques such as ionospheric anomaly analysis, Global Positioning System (GPS) signal interference, and localized telemetry disruption are encouraged. Outputs should be operator-meaningful and enhance unclassified tipping and queuing workflows. The solution must meet all development, operational, and cybersecurity requirements necessary for deployment on classified systems.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the USAF and/or USSF need(s).   2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.   3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The goal of the Phase II effort is to develop and deploy a real-time hardware and/or software capability that can detect, track, and predict the path of high-velocity objects transiting through the upper atmosphere (200–400 km altitude) at space-capable velocities. The solution must identify the time, location, and vector of these objects, and—if Earth-bound—predict impact time and location. This will include but is not limited to data-driven approaches capable of handling large data volumes, real-time data ingestion, and efficiency in data processing time. This capability will enhance USSF’s SDA by addressing existing sensor and detection gaps associated with non-traditional propulsion methods and exotic orbits. Key objectives include:   - Improve and operationalize a prototype developed in the Phase I-type feasibility study.   - Refine detection algorithms using ionospheric, geomagnetic, and SDR-based data inputs.   - Expand the system’s ability to associate and localize multiple disturbances into a single object event.   - Enhance model evaluation metrics, such as detection accuracy, latency, and false alarm rate.   - Integrate predictive modeling to estimate Earth-bound object impact locations and time windows.   - Collaborate with SSC SDA TAP Lab to ensure solution usability and mission alignment.   Expected Deliverables May Include:   - A deployable hardware and/or software prototype capable of processing real-time sensor data from sources such as SuperDARN, USGS, and web-accessible SDRs.   - Detecting and tracking objects traveling at suborbital (“space-capable”) speeds.   - Generating a complete track: time, location, and velocity vector.   - Predicting the Earth impact point for relevant objects.   - A validated integration API compatible with existing SDA toolchains.   - Data publishing capability to the UDL.   - Operator-focused interface or output format to support unclassified tipping and queuing.   - System documentation including architecture and design, integration instructions, and cybersecurity compliance package for classified system use.    PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III effort will focus on scaling and operationalizing the software system developed in Phase II to support the comprehensive analysis of all launch and high-velocity atmospheric events, not limited to suborbital or “space-capable” transits. The system will be enhanced to provide automated, real-time alerts and impact predictions, improving strategic responsiveness, and overall space domain awareness for U.S. military operations. This may involve the development of advanced notification systems capable of disseminating critical information to relevant stakeholders in real-time or near-real-time and facilitate prompt decision-making and responsiveness. The final solution should not involve heuristic methodology but should be founded on data-driven decisions using large volumes of data in real-time. Key Phase III efforts may include:   - Integration of broader data sources and advanced analytics to improve detection reliability and precision.   - Deployment of real-time notification systems capable of distributing alerts to relevant stakeholders for faster decision-making and response.   - Optimization for operational environments, including cybersecurity, scalability, and classified system deployment.   This capability directly supports national security objectives by enabling early warning, characterization, and attribution of unconventional space or atmospheric activities. The core technology developed through this effort has strong dual-use applicability:   - Commercial satellite operators can leverage the system to monitor threats to on-orbit assets from suborbital events or debris.   - Spaceport operators can use it for enhanced launch safety and atmospheric situational awareness.   - Civil agencies (e.g., National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)) may integrate the tool into broader space traffic management and launch event tracking frameworks.   - Academic and research institutions may use the system to study upper atmospheric dynamics or support scientific missions.   By offering a modular, API-accessible, and extensible platform, the solution can serve both defense and commercial markets, maximizing its operational utility and economic impact.   REFERENCES:   1.

"Underwater Sensing in Surf Zone Environments","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI & Autonomy   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an underwater sensor optimized for size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) that can be mounted on a small uncrewed boat to detect bathymetry and underwater hazards in shallow, bubbly environments.​   DESCRIPTION: There is an increasing need to enable U.S. Army sustainment and maneuver support operations through littoral environments, including shallow-water and surfzone based landings, in potentially contested regions. In particular, enabling maritime operations and autonomous distribution to support logistics over the shore for the Joint Forces was recently identified as an S&T priority. In these over-the-shore operations, mapping bathymetry and shallow water hazards (e.g., unexploded ordinance) are of primary importance to ensure safe, efficient, and effective force projection. On exposed coasts, bubbles from breaking waves are a typical environmental impediment that attenuate acoustic signals denying adequate sensing, which leaves crewed or uncrewed systems with limited situational awareness in a particularly challenging environment, arguably the most critical portion of any transit.​   Surfzone bubbles range in sizes, depending on whether they are part of the alpha plume (initial injection) with sizes ranging from cm to tens of micros or the gamma plume (resident plume of smaller bubbles), the both of which creates attenuation of acoustic signals (Deane G. B., 1997, 1999). Leighton (2010) highlighted methods to classify bubbles and reduce their clutter using a Twin Inverted Pair Sonar (TWIPS) signal, motivated by signals used by dolphins. This was examined in boat wakes by Leighton (2011). Lee (2016) highlights bubble’s non-linear response as a potential method for discerning bubbles from hard targets. Yang (2012) explored bubble removal through doppler shifting signals, similarly, explored in a boat wake. ​   The goal of this topic is to develop a system capable of sensing the seafloor (or hazards proud to the seafloor) through bubbly environments like the surfzone in real-time as part of the onboard signal processing so it can potentially be used for real-time navigation. The final product should be a portable underwater sensor (e.g., acoustic sounder or other sensing device that meets the objectives described here) that can be mounted on vessels (large and small) and ruggedized to withstand the high hydrodynamic loading that commonly occurs in the surfzone. The proposed system should have similar form-factors and power requirements with typical state-of-the-art sonars used on uncrewed surface vehicles. Since the surf zone environment is inherently shallow, the minimum range of reliable detection must be as close as 10 cm from the sensor head. ​   Both acoustic and non-acoustic sensing methods will be considered. Acoustic sensing methods need not use methods mentioned in cited literature, though proposers are encouraged to be familiar with the work cited in this document. The minimum viable product demonstrates a producible single beam sonar or equivalent non-acoustic solution that can be used on a vessel as small as a single person portable Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). Ideally, the capability/technology should be transferable to multi-dimensional sensing, such as multi-beam and/or side scan to be used on USVs.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.       Demonstrate the feasibility of sensing with a single beam sonar through bubble media in a laboratory (or isolated/simplified field) environment. Develop a test case that vary bubble sizes and concentrations and highlight the capability of the developed technology’s ability to enhance perception through these different conditions. In this stage, it is preferred if the performer can identify environmental features that have the highest impact on performance (e.g. range, bubble size, bubble/sediment concentrations, etc.) identifying seafloor. The most effective methods will be determined and proposed for Phase II.   PHASE II: Manufacture field prototype single beam (preferred multi-beam or Side-scan) and demonstrate in field relevant environment. Phase II will focus on manufacturing a field ready prototype and test in a field relevant environment for single beam and extension to side-scan or multi-beam sonar. Develop a field test to demonstrate the developed sensor. This could be done on a small (un/crewed) craft. The Government may be able to support experimentation and validation if the vendor is unable to develop a safe surf-zone testing/experimentation operation. Technology should be demonstratable in a range of breaking wave conditions against a known truth. Not only should the bottom be clear in the backscatter signal, but performer should develop a bottom tracking algorithm that can be used to track the bottom in a wide range of conditions. Reporting tracked bottom should follow applicable conventions. Accurate timing of ping should be available. Data should be available via relevant serial protocols and ethernet (at least). Geometries should consider usage mounting on small uncrewed surface vehicles.   Deliver a reporting document: (1) a computer-aided design (CAD) model of developed technology(s) (2) the experimental procedures and results that demonstrate the process meets the performance requirements; (3) the developed system. A favorable performance evaluation will lead into Phase III applications. All research, development, and prototype designs shall be documented with detailed descriptions and specifications of the composition, fabrication, microstructure, and mechanical performance of the prototype repair materials.        PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a strong commercial hydrographic survey industry that could benefit from this technology. Hydrographic surveys are required as part of every USACE Civil Works beach and navigation project nationally, and are used widely within the commercial dredging industry and maritime safety industries.  Presently, operation in the surf-zone is constrained to low or non-breaking wave conditions, meaning the ability to collect these data are significantly weather-constrained.         REFERENCES:    https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/102/5/2671/558076/Sound-generation-and-air-entrainment-by-breaking   https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/29/7/1520-0485_1999_029_1393_aepabs_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display   https://pubs.aip.org/as       KEYWORDS: Surf Zone; Autonomy; Landing; Acoustics; Bubbles; Sensing; Underwater Sensing; Acoustic Sensors ",A25D-019,BOTH,STTR,DOD,ARMY,"August 20, 2025","July 2, 2025","July 2, 2025",https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/submissions/solicitation-documents/active-solicitations,Open,2025,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/12158

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to develop a scalable, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled decision-support framework that enables faster, more informed prioritization of emerging technologies across the space sustainment and logistics enterprise. Project AXIS 54 will equip cross-functional teams with structured tools to assess innovation alignment, technical maturity, and operational relevance—reducing transition friction and accelerating mission-impactful capabilities. The Phase I objective is to design and validate core framework components, AI integration pathways, and representative use cases to guide prototype development in Phase II.   DESCRIPTION: Modern defense innovation often excels at the edge but stalls at the center—where promising technologies struggle to transition due to fragmented visibility, misaligned priorities, and lack of actionable evaluation tools. From concept to prototype, many initiatives fail to bridge the gap between innovation and operational impact. Project AXIS 54 addresses this challenge by delivering a practical, AI-enabled framework to assess, prioritize, and align emerging technologies with mission objectives. Designed for use by capability developers, acquisition teams, and decision-makers across the space logistics and sustainment enterprise, AXIS 54 will support:   - Scoring and visualization of initiatives based on operational relevance, technical maturity, transition readiness, and system feasibility.  - Warfighter-centric planning using intuitive visual models that promote alignment across stakeholders.  - Feedback loops that track early-stage innovations and guide them toward successful integration.   AI will serve as a core enabler, automating pattern recognition across portfolios, flagging integration risks, and surfacing dependencies. Machine learning models will continuously refine prioritization logic using real-world datasets, improving insight fidelity and accelerating informed decision-making. Aligned with the Secretary of Defense’s 17 priority areas—including readiness, innovation speed, and ecosystem resilience—AXIS 54 enables structured yet flexible evaluation of technology portfolios. It empowers leaders to elevate the most mission-relevant innovations, reinforcing readiness and sustainment in support of high-priority U.S. Space Force (USSF) operations. Instead of delivering a rigid platform, AXIS 54 will offer a modular toolkit—scalable for enterprise planning and adaptable for agile experimentation teams. It ensures that initiatives with the greatest potential for lethality, agility, and sustainability are identified early, matured strategically, and transitioned efficiently.   PHASE I: The Phase I objective is to establish the foundational elements of a modular decision-support toolkit that enables cross-functional teams to assess, align, and communicate the operational value of emerging technologies. Phase I focuses on validating a scalable, AI-enabled framework that helps prioritize innovation efforts in alignment with Space Systems Command (SSC), SpaceWERX, and broader USSF mission objectives. The scope and key tasks for this Phase I effort include:    1. Framework Blueprint Development – Design a practical scoring and assessment model incorporating real-world evaluation criteria—such as value-to-mission, maturity level, transition feasibility, and sustainment impact—used by SSC/S4 and innovation stakeholders.  2.

PHASE II: The objective for Phase II is to develop and deliver a functional, AI-enabled prototype of the AXIS 54 framework that supports enterprise-level innovation planning, technology prioritization, and transition decision-making. The system will be co-developed with a government partner—such as SSC/S4, SpaceWERX, or a relevant program office—to ensure alignment with mission needs and real-world operational workflows. Consider the following during the Phase II approach:   - Collaborative Development: Work closely with government stakeholders to tailor the toolkit’s capabilities to actual use cases, workflows, and decision environments. This ensures the tool enhances—not disrupts—existing processes for capability planning and tech transition.  - AI/ML Integration: Deploy and train machine learning models using curated, relevant datasets to support prioritization scoring, dependency mapping, and readiness forecasting. Emphasis will be placed on explainability, transparency, and user trust.  - Operational Use Cases: Apply the prototype to live or recent innovation efforts (e.g., Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) portfolios, non-Program of Record (non-POR) pathfinders) to demonstrate its effectiveness in streamlining evaluations, surfacing transition risks, and identifying portfolio synergies.  - User-Centered Design: Refine visual interfaces, dashboards, and interaction pathways based on feedback from capability developers, program managers (PMs), and mission owners to ensure usability and adoption.   Deliverables may include:  - Fully functional AXIS 54 prototype system.  - Integrated AI/ML modules for initiative scoring, risk flagging, and value analysis.  - Pilot demonstrations in one or more operational environments.  - Stakeholder feedback report and performance evaluation.  - Phase III transition plan with pathways for broader DoD and commercial adoption.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: For Phase III, military applications include:   - Strengthens strategic technology insertion and long-term sustainment planning across SSC portfolios.  - Institutionalizes repeatable transition pathways for SBIR/STTR efforts, Pathfinder projects, and other innovation pipelines.  - Provides Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and acquisition leaders with visibility into technology value, maturity, and risk throughout the development lifecycle.  - Enables structured evaluation and integration of non-POR capabilities that offer high operational value to the warfighter.  - Leverages AI/ML to surface emerging opportunities, flag integration risks, and support real-time, enterprise-level trade-off analysis.   Commercial applications may include:  - Highly applicable to organizations managing complex research and development (R&D) pipelines, particularly those with dual-use technology portfolios.  - Supports strategic planning and prioritization in commercial aerospace, spaceport logistics, advanced manufacturing, and defense-adjacent sectors.  - Improves communication and alignment between technical, operational, and business leadership in innovation-centric enterprises.  - Offers AI-driven portfolio analytics and insights to enhance innovation strategy, reduce investment risk, and accelerate time-to-market.   For transition pathways, the government opportunities may involve the adoption through SSC, SpaceWERX, and/or other innovation-focused DoD entities. Private sector opportunities may involve commercial deployment through SaaS or enterprise software licensing for R&D strategy, innovation portfolio management, and investment planning.   Ultimately, AXIS 54 bridges the gap between innovation and implementation—equipping both military and commercial decision-makers with a robust, AI-enabled framework to make faster, more informed decisions about which technologies to advance and how best to deploy them.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this effort is to establish the technical feasibility of applying Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum Optimization (QO) to space logistics planning, demand forecasting, and mobility optimization. This effort will develop and benchmark a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for a representative logistics scenario, assessing performance improvements over classical models. The Phase I goal is to validate the potential of QML/QO to enhance decision speed, adaptability, and mission resilience in dynamic, contested environments—laying the foundation for a scalable platform to be developed in Phase II. This aligns with the U.S. Space Force (USSF) Mission Sustainment Strategy and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) objectives for digital logistics modernization and survivable supply chain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The Department of the Air Force (DAF) and USSF face escalating complexity in sustaining agile, resilient logistics across terrestrial, orbital, and emerging space environments. Existing logistics planning systems are overly manual, computationally limited, and poorly suited for dynamic, contested scenarios. As logistics demands expand to include rapid orbital resupply, lunar outposts, and interplanetary assets, there is an urgent need for advanced decision-support tools. Hybrid quantum-classical computing approaches—including QML and QO—have demonstrated early promise in tackling combinatorially complex logistics challenges, such as:   - Reducing compute time by orders of magnitude for vehicle routing problems (VRP), job scheduling, and inventory optimization.  - Enabling real-time planning adaptations under operational stressors and adversarial disruptions.   - Scaling across terrestrial, orbital, lunar, and interplanetary logistics architectures.   Core capability areas to be explored in this effort include:  1. Quantum-Enhanced Demand Forecasting: Leveraging QML to model operational and environmental data, enabling superior responsiveness in uncertain and fast-changing mission environments.  2. Hybrid Quantum Optimization for Routing & Scheduling: Applying quantum algorithms—such as quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) and quantum annealing—to solve NP-hard logistics problems and benchmarking them against classical methods.  3. Mission-Aware, Real-Time Logistics Planning: Integrating real-time data (e.g., weather, adversary actions, orbital mechanics) into optimization engines for continuous re-planning and mission adaptation.  4. Resilient, Contested Logistics Management: Modeling logistics risk under degraded conditions and exploring blockchain-enabled logistics chains for verifiability and control in adversarial domains.  5. Dual-Use and Digital Integration: Aligning with Logistics 4.0 transformation goals by enabling interoperability with DoD digital twins, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled mobility planning tools, and autonomous logistics systems.   Phase I will explore technical feasibility, prototype hybrid algorithmic models, and establish performance baselines. This effort directly supports the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy by advancing decision advantage, predictive planning, and mission survivability through next-generation logistics computing.   PHASE I: The objective for Phase I is to establish the technical feasibility and operational relevance of QML and QO for enhancing space logistics planning and demand forecasting. Phase I will focus on developing and evaluating a hybrid quantum-classical approach to solve logistics challenges such as dynamic routing, scheduling, or inventory management in space and contested terrestrial environments. Key tasks include:   - Develop a prototype algorithm or simulation that applies QML or QO techniques to a relevant logistics use case (e.g., vehicle routing, resupply scheduling, or demand forecasting).  - Construct a hybrid quantum-classical model, utilizing Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, classical decomposition strategies, and variational quantum algorithms where applicable.  - Benchmark the quantum-enabled solution against traditional classical optimization models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability under uncertainty.  - Engage logistics stakeholders (USSF, Space Systems Command (SSC), U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to validate use case relevance and gather mission-specific planning requirements.   Deliverables may include:  - A working prototype simulation or algorithm test case demonstrating the selected quantum technique.   - A comparative analysis report detailing performance trade-offs between quantum and classical approaches.   - A stakeholder engagement report summarizing feedback, mission alignment, and integration opportunities.   - A Phase II roadmap outlining pathways for algorithm maturation, scalability improvements, and field validation in real-world operational environments.    PHASE II: The Phase II objective is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional, scalable quantum-enhanced logistics optimization platform using QML and QO. This system will integrate with operational logistics architectures from USSF, U.S. Air Force (USAF), and USTRANSCOM to enable real-time, resilient, and predictive decision-making for space and terrestrial sustainment operations. Key focus areas include:   - Platform Development: Build a full-stack hybrid quantum-classical optimization engine, leveraging QUBO formulations, quantum annealing, and/or variational quantum algorithms to solve NP-hard logistics problems at scale.  - System Integration: Develop secure and interoperable APIs to connect the platform with existing DoD logistics systems, digital twin architectures, and planning tools (e.g., Spaceport Common Operating Picture, AI-based cargo management platforms).  - Operational Validation: Apply the platform to mission-relevant use cases such as dynamic routing and scheduling under degraded or adversarial conditions, real-time resupply logistics and campaign planning, and mobility as well as sustainment optimization across orbital, lunar, and terrestrial nodes.   - Human-Machine Interface: Design an intuitive user interface for planners, analysts, and logisticians, enabling transparent interaction with quantum-driven outputs.  - Performance Benchmarking: Conduct comparative analysis of platform performance versus classical optimization solutions in representative mission environments.

"Project KARMEN: Rapid-Turnaround Spacelift Cargo Test Platform for Empirical Qualification ","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The goal for this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate a reusable, rapid-turnaround test platform capable of evaluating the behavior, survivability, and environmental response of various equipment, supplies, and materials under actual spacelift conditions—including launch, suborbital flight, microgravity exposure, and recovery. The platform should support high-fidelity data collection to enable empirical cargo qualification, with applications across defense, commercial, and academic logistics integration.   DESCRIPTION: This effort will close a critical gap between theoretical Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based cargo prioritization tools and the physical behavior of various supplies, materials, and equipment payloads during launch, flight, and reentry. As the U.S. government and commercial space industry continue to evolve logistics and supply chain concepts for orbital and suborbital operations, a critical capability gap remains: there is no standard platform for empirically testing how various commercial and industrial goods behave under actual spacelift conditions. Current qualification methods rely heavily on ground-based simulations, which cannot fully replicate the combined effects of launch, microgravity, reentry, and recovery. Without real-world test data, cargo survivability and mission reliability remain uncertain—particularly for next-generation logistics missions envisioned by the U.S. Space Force (USSF).   This topic seeks to develop a reusable, rapidly deployable test platform that can deliver modular payloads into suborbital trajectories to simulate relevant spaceflight conditions. The system should support the collection of high-fidelity environmental and structural data throughout the flight profile, including acceleration, shock, temperature, and pressure variations. The envisioned testbed should be capable of:   - Supporting payload exposure to microgravity and low-G environments;  - Executing high-precision recovery at designated landing sites;  - Enabling modular payload integration for various types of cargo and Classes of Supply;  - Operating from multiple locations with minimal launch infrastructure;  - Completing flight and recovery cycles within 48 hours to support high-tempo testing;  - Supporting unpowered or passive recovery modes, as applicable;  - Enabling repeatable, scalable test campaigns without requiring major platform refurbishment.   This effort will enable the physical validation of cargo behavior, complementing digital modeling and AI-based prioritization tools. The resulting capability will inform packaging design, handling procedures, and cargo certification pathways for both U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial logistics operations, contributing to mission readiness, energy efficiency, and reduced risk across the space supply chain.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic and Phase I proposals will not be accepted for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The goal of Phase II is to design, build, and demonstrate a flight-ready, reusable launch and recovery platform that can evaluate the physical behavior, survivability, and environmental response of various supplies, materials, and equipment during suborbital spacelift conditions. The platform should enable modular payload integration and collect high-resolution environmental data across the entire flight profile, including launch, microgravity exposure, and recovery. The effort will culminate in at least one end-to-end suborbital test flight, including launch, flight, landing, and data collection. The demonstration should reflect operationally relevant logistics conditions and support data collection to inform cargo certification, packaging design, and supply chain integration. Key objectives include:   - Develop a modular test platform capable of reaching suborbital altitudes (120+ km) and supporting high-precision recovery;  - Integrate instrumented payload bays with the ability to capture data on shock, vibration, temperature, acceleration, and structural effects;  - Demonstrate the platform’s ability to accommodate a range of commercial and DoD cargo types;  - Validate rapid turnaround capability, supporting repeatable test campaigns with 48-hour or less recovery-to-relaunch timelines;  - Generate empirical test data to support refinement of cargo preparation standards and inform operational logistics planning;  - Enable integration with future supply chain validation frameworks, including “Operational Energy for Space” efforts.   Expected deliverables include:   - A reusable, operational suborbital logistics test platform;  - A modular, secured payload bay adaptable to multiple cargo types;  - Flight-qualified instrumentation kits for high-fidelity environmental data capture;  - A comprehensive flight test report, including cargo survivability and readiness metrics;  - Documentation to support future system integration and logistics planning use cases;  - A transition plan outlining continued development and potential adoption within defense and commercial logistics sectors.   This Phase II effort will produce a working prototype that fills a critical logistics testing gap. By enabling rapid, reusable suborbital test flights, it provides a practical method for validating material and cargo performance in realistic spacelift conditions. The capability supports USSF’s objectives for Operational Energy, mission readiness, and energy-efficient logistics integration. Long-term, the platform can serve as a dual-use qualification tool for defense, aerospace, commercial, and academic applications.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The KARMEN platform will provide the DAF and broader DoD with a capability to empirically qualify cargo for spacelift missions through real-world suborbital testing. By collecting environmental and survivability data, the system will reduce the need for energy-intensive retests and prevent mission failures caused by unvalidated cargo. Key military transition opportunities include:   - Empirical test qualification of supplies, materials, and equipment for space-based logistics and forward deployment;  - Integration into Space Systems Command’s (SSC) operational supply chain modernization and sustainment workflows;  - Support for “Operational Energy for Space” by validating cargo handling, packaging, and deployment procedures that reduce propellant usage and increase mission efficiency;  - Establishment of a certification framework for cargo readiness that supports distributed operations and improves logistics resilience.   Commercial applications include:  - The reusable KARMEN platform offers substantial commercial value as a dual-use testbed for companies preparing terrestrial goods for space environments. It can serve as a low-cost, high-cadence launch and recovery system for:  - Aerospace, biotech, and defense firms seeking cargo qualification for orbital or suborbital delivery;  - Commercial entities supporting space tourism, research missions, or lunar logistics, where preflight validation of cargo is critical;  - STEM programs, academic research institutions, and early-stage startups looking to test materials, sensors, or systems in realistic launch conditions without the high costs of orbital missions.   KARMEN will serve as a bridge between ground-based cargo modeling and real-world launch behavior, supporting both DoD operational readiness and commercial space innovation. It will establish a reusable, scalable model for validating cargo across multiple sectors, while reinforcing energy efficiency and reducing risk across the space supply chain.   REFERENCES:   1.

"Virtual Space Cargo Deployment Function for AI-Driven Logistics Planning and Simulation","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sustainment & Logistics   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: The objective for this effort is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin platform to support space cargo deployment planning, simulation, and decision support for U.S. Space Force (USSF) logistics operations. The system—referred to as the Virtual Space Cargo Deployment Function (VS-CDF)—should enable mission planners to model, visualize, and optimize cargo movements across the full deployment lifecycle. Key capabilities include pre-mission scenario modeling, intelligent configuration of cargo based on vehicle, mission, and environmental constraints, and dynamic simulation of real-time logistics events and contingencies. The solution should support integration with existing U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) logistics, mobility, and space operations systems to improve agility, reduce mission risk, and enhance sustainment readiness in multi-domain operations.   DESCRIPTION: The USSF requires advanced tools to plan, simulate, and execute logistics missions in the space domain. Current logistics modeling and planning systems are primarily designed for terrestrial operations and do not adequately account for the complexities of orbital mechanics, rapid launch events, intermodal cargo transfers, or the dynamic nature of space mobility. This limits planning agility, increases mission risk, and hinders the development of responsive and adaptive sustainment operations in line with Space Doctrine Publication 4-0 and the USSF Mission Sustainment Strategy.   This topic seeks to develop a VS-CDF—a digital twin environment that enables real-time planning, simulation, optimization, and visualization of cargo deployment for space logistics. The VS-CDF should support both pre-mission and live mission phases, providing operational planners with AI-driven decision-support tools, immersive modeling capabilities, and integrated risk analytics. Key capabilities of the envisioned system may include:   - AI-based cargo optimization, considering constraints such as vehicle configuration, mass, power, volume, payload dynamics, and orbital conditions;  - Virtual mission planning and execution tools, enabling full-spectrum scenario modeling for rapid resupply, disaster response, and contingency operations;  - Digital twin visualization and intuitive user interfaces, including 3D modeling, augmented/virtual reality integration, and multi-modal human-machine interfaces (e.g., gesture, voice, touchscreen);  - Supply chain risk management and contingency simulation, to assess disruptions, prioritize routing, and inform cargo sequencing under degraded conditions;  - System interoperability and integration with DoD logistics networks and space operations systems, including the Spaceport of the Future Common Operating Picture (COP) and Joint logistics nodes such as U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM),  Major Command (MAJCOM), and Field Command (FLDCOM).   The VS-CDF platform will enable more effective logistics decision-making for contested and distributed space operations, improving mission readiness, reducing deployment timelines, and enabling a shift toward predictive and energy-efficient sustainment practices.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of the Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving USAF and/or USSF need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: Under this D2P2 effort, the awardee will develop and demonstrate a functional VS-CDF—a digital twin software environment designed to support end-to-end planning, simulation, and decision support for space cargo logistics. The system will serve as a planning and analytics platform for mission stakeholders across the USSF and joint logistics enterprise, enabling predictive modeling, AI-based optimization, immersive visualization, and integration with real-time operational data. The Phase II objectives include:   - Develop an operational prototype of the VS-CDF digital twin environment, capable of simulating and optimizing cargo deployment across multiple mission types and logistics scenarios;  - Implement AI-enabled tools for cargo configuration, route planning, mission timeline optimization, and contingency response;  - Enable collaborative mission planning, supporting multi-user interaction across Joint, Coalition, and interagency logistics teams;  - Validate system functionality using live or historically representative DoD logistics data, assessing system accuracy, adaptability, and decision impact under realistic operational conditions.   Expected deliverables include:  - A fully functional prototype of the VS-CDF system, integrated with representative DoD logistics networks and space operations systems (e.g., USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM);  - Embedded AI models for cargo optimization, risk analysis, and scenario adaptation;  - Immersive visualization and user interface components, including 3D modeling, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) elements, or intuitive controls (as appropriate to the approach);  - A demonstration campaign conducted through logistics exercises, simulations, or wargames to assess mission utility;  - A final report documenting test results, user feedback, system performance metrics, and integration outcomes;  - A transition and commercialization roadmap outlining next steps for operational deployment and dual-use adoption.   The completed prototype will provide the USSF with a decision-support environment tailored to the unique challenges of space mobility and sustainment logistics. By enabling simulation-driven planning, risk-informed decision-making, and AI-powered optimization, the VS-CDF will enhance agility, readiness, and operational energy efficiency across both DoD and commercial logistics operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase III effort will focus on transitioning the VS-CDF from a prototype to an operationally deployed capability supporting both military and commercial logistics ecosystems. The platform will serve as a decision support and simulation tool for complex, multi-domain cargo deployment planning—bridging the gap between terrestrial logistics systems and emerging space mobility operations. Military applications include:   - Provide a mission-ready logistics decision support environment for Space Systems Command (SSC), USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, and Joint logistics planners;  - Support operational planning and rapid deployment activities, including contingency logistics and distributed sustainment in contested domains;  - Integrate into training environments and exercise campaigns to enhance warfighter readiness and simulate space logistics missions under real-world constraints;  - Align with the USSF’s emphasis on sustainment agility, operational energy efficiency, and predictive supply chain planning.   Commercial applications include:  - Serve as a logistics optimization and simulation tool for aerospace, satellite launch, and space mobility companies managing commercial cargo operations;  - Enable advanced supply chain modeling and risk assessment for global logistics providers, intermodal transport planners, and commercial shipping networks;  - Support digital twin integration for defense contractors, airlines, and manufacturers seeking AI-based cargo planning and routing solutions;  - Extend to STEM education and academic research, offering a virtualized space logistics environment for training, experimentation, and collaboration.   For the transition plan, the DoD adoption will be pursued through coordination with SSC, USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, and FLDCOM for integration into operational planning tools and logistics networks. Commercial transition pathways will include partnerships with aerospace firms, logistics technology providers, and digital twin software vendors. The system will also be designed for interoperability with existing AI-based logistics tools, supporting scalable deployment across both DoD and private-sector operations.   The expected Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at Phase III Entry is TRL 8 or 9, following successful operational demonstration and validation.   REFERENCES:   1. U.S. Space Force. (2023, March).

"Affordable Release Mechanism (ARM)","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Space Technology   The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.   OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop an expendable, low-cost release mechanism that is agnostic of cargo container providers and tailored specifically for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. As the U.S. Space Force explores rapid global mobility through suborbital or orbital reentry of materiel payloads, there is a growing need for modular, affordable systems that do not rely on the expensive, high-RAM (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability) release mechanisms designed for traditional aircraft platforms. This release mechanism must be compatible with various commercial and government-provided reentry containers and enable rapid, mission-specific payload integration—essentially serving as a plug-and-play solution for space cargo. Drawing parallels to AFRL’s AgilePod for ISR payloads, this innovation would empower materiel transport teams to quickly adapt payloads across missions without reengineering delivery systems for each use case. A standardized, low-cost release interface would reduce total lifecycle costs and increase operational agility for space-based materiel transport, ultimately supporting the Rocket Cargo objectives and enabling a more flexible, scalable approach to global reentry transport and sustainment.   DESCRIPTION: Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to support Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. This topic seeks to develop a low-cost, expendable release mechanism that is agnostic of cargo container provider. The objective is to broaden the industrial base and lower the cost of release mechanisms to the point they are considered expendable. This will enable faster payload integration and turnaround by allowing containerized payloads to be swapped in minutes, regardless of the mission type.   The concept draws parallels to AFRL’s AgilePod for ISR but is intended for any military payload, offering a “plug-and-play” capability across different container systems. This modularity would increase the range of missions supported by a single container platform and improve materiel transport agility. By creating a standardized release interface, the DAF can increase flexibility and reduce costs for reentry-capable space containers and delivery systems, directly supporting Rocket Cargo goals.   PHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the D2P2 proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force and/or Space Force stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the DAF customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:   1. Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Air Force and/or Space Force need(s).  2. Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.  3. Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.   PHASE II: The Eligibility for a Direct to Phase Two (D2P2) is predicated on the offeror having performed a “Phase I-like” effort predominantly separate from the SBIR/STTR Programs. These efforts may include M&S, simulation of prototype concepts, cost benefit analysis, system-of-systems studies, experimentation and evaluation of operational imperatives to enable future concepts. Prototypes, M&S and experimentation should explore a wide range of integrating commercial capabilities to support the operational imperatives. These capabilities should consider areas that are unique to military operations, materiel transport, mission planning, mission execution, and base sustainment. A goal is for Phase II efforts to conduct sub-scale experiments and provide test articles for further test and demonstration. Experiments should address military-unique requirements that may not be otherwise met by commercial capabilities.   The Phase II objective is to advance the development of an expendable, low-cost, container-agnostic release mechanism for Rocket Cargo materiel transport missions. The goal is to deliver a standardized solution capable of supporting rapid payload integration across a broad range of military and commercial cargo containers. Eligibility for this D2P2 topic is based on the offeror having completed a “Phase I-like” effort independently of the SBIR/STTR program. This prior work must demonstrate technical feasibility and alignment with Department of the Air Force (DAF) operational imperatives.   Acceptable Prior Work Includes:  - Modeling & Simulation (M&S) of release concepts  - Prototype concept development and risk reduction  - Cost-benefit analysis or lifecycle cost modeling  - System-of-systems analysis of modular payload interfaces  - Field testing or lab experimentation validating separation mechanics or payload integration  - Evaluation of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) adaptation potential   Phase II Expectations:  - Conduct sub-scale experiments and prototype testing in simulated or relevant operational environments  - Deliver test articles suitable for additional government testing and demonstration  - Refine the design based on performance, manufacturability, and feedback from integration testing  - Ensure the solution meets DAF-specific requirements for modularity, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness  - Identify pathways to full-scale manufacturing and deployment   The end state is to enable rapid integration and separation of space payloads via a universal, low-cost release mechanism that supports Rocket Cargo materiel transport operations.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III shall include upgrades to the analysis, M&S, T&E results and provide mature prototypes of system concepts. Phase III shall provide a business plan and address the ability to transition technology and system concepts to commercial applications. The adapted non-Defense commercial solutions shall provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential Governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications. Integration and other technical support to operational users may be required.   The Phase III objective is to advance the Affordable Release Mechanism (ARM) from prototype to field-ready, flight-qualified technology through operational testing, system maturation, and commercial transition planning. Phase III efforts will focus on validating performance in operational-like environments, supporting integration with government platforms, and exploring broader commercial utility. Military Applications include:   - Rocket Cargo materiel transport for USSF and USAF missions  - Rapid launch and reentry materiel transport for agile space operations  - Standardized, modular release systems to support distributed space assets and cargo flexibility  - Reduced lifecycle and integration costs for DAF missions requiring payload reconfiguration   Commercial Applications include:  - Adaptable payload deployment systems for commercial launch vehicle operators  - Universal interfaces for containerized space materiel transport and return systems  - Broader use in aerospace, delivery systems, and reusable vehicle components   The end state is to transition the ARM system into both military and commercial use to support scalable, low-cost, container-agnostic payload release in dynamic, high-tempo space materiel transport environments. By enabling fast integration and deployment across diverse mission sets, ARM increases mission agility, platform interoperability, and operational efficiency for both government and industry stakeholders.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transactions for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this topic. This program solicitation is intended for information purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.      Primary objectives of this topic include exploring innovative technology solutions applicable to both defense and non-defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base for defense. This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype-validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and Phase II schedules. This topic is aimed at applied research and development efforts rather than “front-end” or basic Research (R)/Research & Development (R&D).       Description:   The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Space Force stakeholders' needs.        Proposed technical solutions should focus on the characteristics outlined in the Evaluation Criteria section of this solicitation.        The topic is truly 'open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-mission fit between a Space Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.      According to the USSF Commercial Space Strategy, there are eight (8) mission areas considered for commercial support: Space Domain Awareness (SDA); Satellite Communications (SATCOM); Space Access, Mobility, and Logistics (SAML); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) – hereafter referred to as Tactical, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (TacSRT); Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM); Cyberspace Operations; Command and Control (C2); and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). Additionally, the USSF will seek hybrid solutions for Space Mission Enablers, those functions that span multiple missions and are fundamental to conducting space operations. Although the USSF also performs missile warning, combat power projection, electromagnetic warfare, and nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection, the USSF is not currently seeking commercial support for these missions.

(T).  The goal is to minimize the system weight below 20 lbs without fuel    System shall be able to operate in parallel with ≥two (2) systems, same model, output, and mode, (T) and up to four (4) systems of same or different types, models, outputs and modes, (O) together to produce greater power and increase overall system reliability   PPG can be optimized to operate on one fuel type or be capable of operating on multiple fuels.  Where applicable, consider operation on DoD approved lubricants and standard military fuels such as JP-8, F-24. DF2 or alternative fuels to include, but not limited to methanol, methanol-water mixture, ALANE (AIH3), High Energy Aluminum (HEA), or Activated Aluminum   The volume of the PPG shall be between 2 – 10 cubic feet   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.      Demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed Platoon Power Generator technology. Identify the technology, fuel choice, along with supporting information. Develop the overall system design, model the size and weight of the system, component choices and sources and perform a comparative analysis of the design metrics with incumbent generator solutions and other technology/fuel implementations from literature. Provide a report on the findings.      PHASE II: Further develop and demonstrate the Platoon Power Generator designed in Phase I.  Performers will source and/or build and test key components of the system leading to the demonstration of a TRL 4 breadboard system during phase II performance. Upon a successful demonstration at TRL 4, refinements will be made to improve the system design and address any findings from the breadboard demonstration. Two functional systems will be delivered to the Army for evaluation at the end of the Phase II effort to support 100 hours of testing each, at the nominal power output of the system.

"Additive Manufacturing for Circuitry","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Computing and Software; Advanced Materials; Microelectronics      OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop open-source machine controller software and custom 3D printing toolheads that enable the fabrication and repair of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The goal is to adapt an existing 3D printer (commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or custom built) with open-source software to support PCB printing capabilities, while also developing modular toolheads optimized for conductive material printing and circuit repair. Small businesses responding to this topic should select or develop a 3D printer that supports an open-source software configuration and modify that software to meet the specific needs of PCB fabrication. Prusa’s 3D printer suite serves as an example of a COTS system that is open-source and allows for custom toolheads, but its use is not required. Companies may choose to work with any 3D printer that fits the open-source requirement or, if necessary, develop a new system. The key focus is ensuring an open, adaptable ecosystem where software and hardware work together to enable PCB printing.      DESCRIPTION: The awarded company will develop:       Open-source machine controller software modifications that enhance an existing open-source 3D printer to support PCB fabrication and repair.      Custom toolheads that enable functionalities such as conductive ink printing, pick-and-place operations, and multi-layer PCB production.       Ideally, the solution should support key functionalities, including:       Integration with a confocal scanner for substrate mapping and quality assurance.   Automated detection and repair of conductive printed traces.   Two methods of first-layer substrate detection to ensure precision.   Point-to-point manual circuit repair capability for user intervention.   Substrate alignment and automated path detection for multi-layer PCB fabrication.   CAD/CAM workflow visualization to streamline design iteration and printing processes.   The ability to project scanned height maps onto a conformal surface for accurate PCB production.   Pick-and-place component alignment that automatically adjusts to the substrate.   The ability to switch between the developed machine controller software and an OEM controller, ensuring flexibility in usage.       This solution must be built within an open-source framework, ensuring adaptability and future development. The key requirement is that the system leverages open-source software and includes custom toolheads designed for PCB manufacturing and repair.      PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.      To establish the feasibility of adapting open-source 3D printing systems for PCB fabrication and repair, the Phase I effort will focus on evaluating candidate COTS or custom-built 3D printers that support open-source machine controller software, conducting a technical assessment of integration pathways for multi-functional toolheads, and developing initial software modules to demonstrate control over basic PCB-relevant operations. Deliverables will include a technical feasibility report outlining the selected hardware platform and its suitability for modular toolhead integration, proof-of-concept demonstrations of software-driven motion control adapted for PCB deposition processes, and conceptual designs for toolheads enabling conductive ink deposition and pick-and-place functions. The Phase I work will also include preliminary software architecture documentation, risk analysis for multi-layer PCB printing integration, and an open-source compliance assessment to ensure future scalability. This foundation will validate the technical and operational viability of the proposed system and inform detailed engineering in Phase II.      PHASE II: The outcome of this SBIR will be the ability to rapidly design/repair/replace obsolete components to combat obsolescence issues and meet mission objectives as well as provide custom stopgap solutions to an already fragile electronics supply chain. This effort relies heavily on machine controller software development for a specific use case.       Machine controller software exists for similar types of machines, maybe not all of the functionality that is being asked for, however, even though the software is mature, it will need to be tailored and proven to work on the AvMC inhouse machine so development work will be needed.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This technology development could be tailored to be a machine agnostic controller software able to realize the potential of many printed microelectronics machines.

"Faraday optical isolator on a photonic integrated laser circuit","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Quantum Science (including Encryption & Computing); Directed Energy; Microelectronics (ME)      OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a fully integrated Faraday optical isolator on a photonic integrated circuit with laser gain      DESCRIPTION: There has been significant progress in developing lower SWaP laser systems for many “complex” laser applications like quantum technology and high energy lasers, however, a low SWaP solution comparable in performance to Faraday isolation does not yet exist. The approach used today is to go off chip into a free space Faraday optical isolator, however, this takes up much more space in a laser system, adds loss (reducing power efficiency) and greatly complicates packaging options for complex systems. On chip ideas typically utilize some non-reciprocal geometry in combination with a powered modulator, however, this adds power to the system, loss, and often are very narrowband reducing flexibility for the approach. Similarly, isolation using Kerr non-linearity in micro resonators is narrow band and only can work for low-agility lasers, which conflicts with an important need for quantum technology.             In this topic, proposers should demonstrate some way to introduce broadband (>10 nm), passive optical isolation onto an integrated laser system using Faraday optical materials with >25 dB isolation and <2 dB insertion loss.         PHASE I: Develop a design and device operation model ready for immediate fabrication. The proposer can choose any particular 10 nm transmission window and center frequency between 2000 and 500 nm for the project. The concept should be adaptable across the Near Infra-Red (NIR) to Visible spectrum with a minimum of architecture and geometry changes even if the size and materials used must change between wavelengths. Phase 1 should deliver an analysis of which material combinations are feasible and one combination that will be demonstrated in Phase II with the design and model that indicated likely success for the chosen Phase II development. A measurement technique should also be designed that could accurately measure the optical isolation and loss on the chip. Phase I Base amount must not exceed $314,363 for a 12-month period of performance.      PHASE II: Build and demonstrate optical isolators that can support >25 dB of optical isolation and <2 dB of forward insertion loss on a photonic integrated circuit platform with optical gain (e.g. a laser or amplifier on the same chip) that could be incorporated into more complex photonic chip platforms via hybrid or heterogenous integration. Phase II Base amount must not exceed $2,095,000 for a 24-month period of performance.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This device is expected to commercially viable immediately after phase II for multiple applications in the private sector such as mulit-beam Lidar, and telecommunications, It is envisioned that a second iteration could make purpose built variants of this amplifier for Directed Energy and multiple quantum applications including quantum computing and sensing which are also dual use.

"Innovative Interceptor Seekers for Missile Defense in the Space Domain","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Microelectronics; Space Technology; Advanced Materials      The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative seekers for future interceptors capable of providing missile defense in the space domain.      DESCRIPTION: The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop and deploy a layered Missile Defense System to defend the United States, its deployed forces, allies, and friends from missile attacks in all phases of flight.  Critical to meeting this mission is the continued development of disruptive technologies that enable missile defense in the contested space domain.     An on-board seeker helps an interceptor “see” a missile threat in order to inform course corrections.  This hardware would need to survive space launch, long-duration standby, high-accelerations during interceptor maneuvers, and operation within space and (potentially) the upper atmosphere.  This hardware would be required to go from a stand-by state to a ready state within seconds and must be capable of acquiring a missile threat at long ranges in a noisy and/or cluttered background.  Finally, this hardware must be compact, affordable, and manufacturable.  MDA is seeking innovative interceptor seekers that meet these attributes.    Singular technologies and/or components would be considered, but higher levels of assembly are highly desired.      PHASE I: Phase I-like proposals will not be evaluated and will be rejected as nonresponsive. For this topic, the Government expects the small business would have accomplished the following in a Phase I-like effort via some other means, e.g., independent research and development (IRAD) or other source, a concept for a workable prototype or design to address, at a minimum, the basic capabilities of the stated objective above. Proposal must show, as appropriate, a demonstrated technical feasibility or nascent capability. The documentation provided must substantiate the proposer’s development of a preliminary understanding of the technology to be applied in their Phase II proposal in meeting topic objectives.   Documentation should comprise all relevant information including, but not limited to, technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results. Feasibility = maturity and what have you already done/validated.   Proposers interested in participating in Direct to Phase II must include in their responses to this topic Phase I feasibility documentation that substantiates the scientific and technical merit and Phase I feasibility described in Phase I above has been met.   (i.e., the small business must have performed a proof of concept like “Phase I” component and/or other validation in a relevant environment, and/or at a much higher TRL level (5 or higher) and describe the potential commercialization applications. The documentation provided must validate that the proposer has completed development of technology in previous work or research completed.)   IRAD work: Documentation should include the most relevant information including, but not limited to: technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and/or performance goals/results. Work submitted within the feasibility documentation must have been substantially performed by the proposer and/or the principal investigator (PI).      PHASE II: Proposed technologies should start at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 (breadboard tested in a laboratory environment) and reach TRL 5 (brassboard tested in a relevant environment) within 2 years.  This Phase II solicitation requires UNCLASSIFIED proposals, with the expectation that most if not all of the work completed would be done at the SECRET or higher classification level.  Please submit proposals that are based on your best skills, experience and capability to deliver innovative technology to support the MDA mission.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III work would likely involve the development of a prototype seeker assembly, proto-qualification of that prototype, and then a space launch to flight demonstrate the prototype and reach TRL 6/7.  Performers are encouraged to partner with non-traditional integrators in order to accelerate the transition of their seeker into a fielded interceptor.

"Photonic Integrated NV Center in Diamond Vector Magnetometers","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Quantum Science (including Encryption & Computing); Microelectronics (ME); Hypersonics (HS)      OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate an On-chip Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond Vector Magnetometer      DESCRIPTION: Quantum “DC” magnetometers have demonstrated their utility for magnetic anomaly detection and navigation. The current high-TRL and commercial prototypes use optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), which offer excellent sensitivity and accuracy at a reasonable size, weight, power, and moderate cost, however, OPMs measure the total field magnitude of a vector field, which creates several limitations in the field including susceptibility to dynamics and “heading error” which originates from how Earth’s magnetic field couples to the sensor. Furthermore, OPMs have “blind spots” known as dead zones which greatly complicate their use in the field. OPMs can be engineered into vector sensors to mitigate some of these effects, however the SWaP and accuracy is compromised when “vectorizing” OPMs. Finally, OPMs are typically hand build with discreet components which makes them difficult to manufacture at scale.      Nitrogen Vacancy-Centers in Diamond (NVD) offer a compelling alternative because they are naturally vector sensors, have no dead zones, and have large dynamic range [1], however, NVD sensors today are power hungry, and require similar complex fabrication as OPMs. They also often lose sensitivity when tightly packaged [2]      This topic seeks “on-chip” NVD sensors that reduce the size, weight, and power requirements and simplify the fabrication to facilitate scaling up manufacture.       In this topic “on-chip” means that the light is contained in guided modes in a planar fabricated structure allowing for hybrid or heterogenous integration of multiple chips as needed. Fiberized and packaged lasers can be off chip and fiber coupled into the NVD sensor, which can be separately packaged. The performance goal is 100 picoTesla / Hz1/2at 1 Hz and 1 nanoTesla accuracy, which is sufficient for magnetic navigation and some magnetic anomaly detection applications.      PHASE I: Develop a design and device operation model ready for immediate fabrication, preferably using commercially accessible fabrication facilities. This would typically exclude University owned research-focused cleanroom facilities unless those facilities are part of some larger institute that facilitates commercial access (e.g. a Microelectronics Commons Hub). The fabrication facility should be capable of supporting initial production of the NVD sensor in quantity 100 per year. Phase I Base amount must not exceed $314,363 for a 12-month period of performance.       PHASE II: Demonstrate an NVD on-chip prototype that is packaged in fiberized photonic package. Demonstrate the sensitivity goal of 100 pT / Hz1/2at 1 Hz (and preferring lower). A vector accuracy of 1 nT should be backed up with a model and a test plan for later validation by the Government in a subsequent effort. The sensor size should be less than 20 cubic centimeters including any lasers, which can be separated into, at most, two containers (i.e. the sensor and laser pump can be packaged separately). This volume excludes electrical input/output and any processing; however, a feasible design for a 200 cc electronics package must also be delivered. The total power dissipated by the NVD sensor system must be less than 1 Watt excluding the power lost by the electronics. The electronics can use more power as needed. Phase II Base amount must not exceed $2,095,000 for a 24-month period of performance.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This device is expected to commercially viable after accuracy validation and electronics miniaturization. It should form a new standard for magnetic navigation and magnetic anomaly detection [1]. There are many potential DoD applications that could use these devices in a Phase III after this Phase II.

"Integrated low noise laser for Barium ion qubits","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Quantum Science (including Encryption & Computing); Directed Energy; Biomedical      OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a scalable, low noise laser for barium ion qubits.      DESCRIPTION: Barium ion qubits are the new preferred choice for ion based quantum computing and potentially atomic clocks because they offer the conveniences of ion trapping for control and robustness, but don’t require (near) ultraviolet lasers that are very difficult to make. The tradeoff is that the most important laser, the “clock” laser is now at 1762 nm, which is outside the spectral region where low noise lasers, high power lasers have been commercialized. Recently, there have been several demonstrations indicating a possible way forward [1,2]. In this project, an integrated approach to develop a laser with 100 mW output with less than -140 dB/Hz random intensity noise (RIN), and less than 100 Hz linewidth is required using a technique that is scalable in power, potentially using multiple channels, and manufacturable. The laser system must also have the needed control mechanisms for frequency tuning to the atomic line.      PHASE I: To qualify for Direct to Phase 2, the proposer must have a system design and device operation model ready for immediate fabrication, preferably using commercially accessible fabrication facilities. This typically excludes University research-focused cleanroom facilities unless those facilities are part of some larger institute that facilitates commercial access (e.g. a Microelectronics Commons Hub). The system design and model should include detailed analysis of the frequency and amplitude noise expected, the control system required, and a system concept for how this laser will fit into a barium ion laser control system that includer other wavelengths.       PHASE II: Build and demonstrate the barium ion clock laser system with 100 Hz linewidth, 100 mW output power, -140 dB/Hz RIN that can lock to Ba+. A surrogate frequency reference is acceptable if the performer doesn’t have a Ba+ spectroscopy capability. Phase II Base amount must not exceed $2,095,000 for a 27-month period of performance.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This device is expected to commercially viable for quantum computing and atomic clock programs funded in the public and private sectors, but also could be commercialized for medical and high energy laser applications because of the wavelengths lower impact on human tissue.

"Predict, Optimize, Recommend, and Track for Adaptive Logistics (PORTAL)​","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Computing and Software; Trusted AI and Autonomy      OBJECTIVE: ​​Develop an AI-enabled predictive logistics software solution, to be used at the Brigade level and below, capable of operating in contested environments, providing real-time tracking, predictive analysis, and AI-generated Courses of Action (COAs) to optimize logistical flow and facilitate mission success.  ​   DESCRIPTION: Modern military operations require agile and resilient logistics in contested environments. Traditional logistics systems struggle to integrate data from disparate sources across Army platforms and the Army is interested in enhancing their capability to rapidly handle changing situations, disruptions, and adversarial actions.  Data from logistics systems such as the Joint Battle Command Platform (JBC-P), Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-A), and SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) could be easier to understand and action if displayed in a more user-centric format. This topic should include AI technology to provide commanders with a comprehensive logistics awareness and decision-making tool that is easy to understand and accessible. The tool should have the ability to track, predict, and recommend, as defined below:    Track: Provide a real-time view of logistics assets, personnel, and supply chains. Create a Common Operating Picture (COP), which clearly depicts inventory (commodities, fuel, ammunition, etc.), vehicle status, and capabilities, while synchronizing efforts and providing commanders with accurate information. This topic will go beyond traditional analog tracking measures to increase awareness and provide real time inventory, status, and resupply requirements for operational units.     Predict: Anticipate potential disruptions, like bottlenecks and logistical shortfalls, using predictive modeling. Forecast individual unit consumption, by classes of supply, to identify problems before they become emergencies. Automatically identify and alert (with advanced notice) when planned resupply operations are insufficient, which can lead to critical shortages.     Recommend: Generate optimized COAs for routes, resupply packages, resource allocation, and risk mitigation. Automatically plan resupply routes and packages to optimize equipment and personnel utilization.    Solutions to be considered will include, but are not limited to, the following capabilities:     Ingest data from the Joint Battle Command Platform (JBCP), Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-A), and other inventory management system(s) such as SAP ERP. Awardees will have access to historical data, in the form of electronic spreadsheets, for training purposes. More details will be made available to the awardee(s). Full integration with JBCP and GCSS-A is a future endeavor but should be considered during development.

Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility equivalent to a Phase I project has been met. Documentation can include data, reports, specific measurements, success criteria of a prototype, etc.   (DIRECT TO) PHASE II: ​​The concept of predictive logistics tracking software has been realized in the commercial sector by multiple companies. Companies have achieved TRL 5-6. Companies have taken different approaches to creating AI-enabled logistical software, with widespread success. The DP2 SBIR will facilitate rigorous testing for selected companies and provide end user feedback for iterative improvement. ​ Refine the preliminary design proposed in the solicitation and create a prototype PORTAL software platform. Companies should work toward connecting this tool to existing military logistics systems and data sources. The final product should improve data flow while receiving and sending data into programs of record (Global Combat Support System-Army) with the aim of working to achieve an Interim Authorization to Test (IATT) and full Authority to Operate (ATO). These goals should be accomplished through training and refining developed models using real-world data and feedback from logistics personnel by leveraging the Southern Border Mission. ​​   The software should generate nuanced and contextually relevant COAs, including alternative options and risk assessments. Execute deliberate after-action reviews (AARs) after training events to iteratively evaluate recommended COAs. Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for visualizing logistics information and interacting with AI-generated recommendations. Companies should budget for quarterly travel to the supported unit conducting rigorous testing and receiving unit feedback (6 visits total over the 18-month period of performance).   For this period of performance, vendors should demonstrate the software solution on their own hardware. For example, the software solution can reside on AI/ML capable computers that the vendor brings to demonstrations or connect to vendor owned servers capable of running the software application via cloud. Companies are expected to articulate hardware and/or cloud computing requirements for future integration with Army units.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Commercial applications for logistical optimization and AI integration include but are not limited to humanitarian aid and disaster relief, supply chain management, delivery scheduling, and traffic management. The ability to analyze current logistical operations, optimize efficiency, and receive AI powered recommendations represents a key capability for commercial application.      Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief: Optimize logistics flows in challenging environments during natural disasters or humanitarian crises.     Supply Chain Management: Enhance commercial supply chain visibility, resilience, and efficiency.    Delivery Scheduling: AI-planned routes to optimize speed and fuel efficiency for shortest routes.     Traffic Management: Improve real-time traffic flow and optimize transportation routes in congested urban environments.

"Cognitive Mapping for Counter-WMD Operations  ","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Computing and Software; Trusted AI   and Autonomy      The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE:   The proposed topic describes an effort to develop and demonstrate cognitive mapping algorithms that leverage knowledge of architectural patterns to produce 2D or 3D maps of building interiors. Integrate the solution into the modular, open mapping architecture developed by the Defense Threat Reduction   Agency’s (DTRA) Mapping and Awareness for CWMD Operations (MACO) program.      DESCRIPTION:    Charged with supporting operations for countering weapons of mass destruction, DTRA leads a broad range of R&D programs that support the Services, SOCOM, and other DoD stakeholders. DTRA research includes technologies such as MACO, which is developed to support missions conducted in underground facilities and other GPS-denied environments.      Conventional SLAM involves using data-heavy point clouds to create a map of the surrounding environment; however, there is much that can be inferred from the architectural details of a structure that is omitted in SLAM-based map construction methods. For instance, long hallways that challenge conventional Light Distance and Ranging (LiDAR) SLAM systems could be refined with the inference that architecturally, most hallways remain a straight, parallel line structure in the map. As the SLAM drifts, the straight, parallel wall assumption would serve to correct that drift by parallelizing the walls.   Similarly, a cognitive mapping system seeing partially into two side-by-side rooms and viewing only part of the shared wall between them could infer that the wall extends the entire length between the two rooms; it may note a grid of columns and infer that distant columns have the same spacing; and it may infer that a stairwell extends from the observed floor up to the highest known floor. By integrating architectural knowledge and design pattern recognition in these ways, this project will enhance the capabilities of traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques.      Through cognitive mapping, solutions will be able to make informed predictions about the environment, even in the presence of incomplete or noisy sensor data. This will enable the creation of more accurate and robust maps, particularly in feature-poor environments like long, smooth hallways or areas with limited visual features. Maps will also carry more information embedded in them, allowing users and autonomous systems to understand the environment, its hazards, and how best to traverse through it without having to interpret direct renderings of sensor data.      Approaches may utilize machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize and infer architectural features and patterns, such as hallway parallelism, shared walls, symmetry in room layouts, staircase & elevator placement, column & beam spacings, and other common design elements. Prototypes may leverage conventional SLAM algorithms and sensors to generate a baseline map, then process it further to incorporate architectural understandings. Maps generated by prototype systems may be 2D or 3D, and may range from whiteboard sketch to architectural blueprint; in any case, they must provide more value than existing SLAM methods by enabling DTRA end users to execute counter-WMD missions in GPS-denied spaces with greater situational awareness. Solutions will be assessed during regular and ongoing mapping experiments and exercises conducted by DTRA and its partners as part of the MACO   program.      PHASE I:    Phase I of this project is data-gathering, processing, and model creation. Activities and deliverables may   include:   Collection of data sets and identification of existing labeled datasets      Annotate and label data with architectural known qualities      Select and implement machine learning methodology and begin training a prototype model      Model optimization and tuning for enhanced spatial reasoning      Deploy simple model for MACO integration and validation         PHASE II:    Phase II expected activities and deliverables include:      Advanced model development, expansion of datasets, and real-time SLAM inference      Testing, assessment, and training of model in varying conditions      Optimize models for NVIDIA compact compute      Create User Interface and/or visualization that integrates architectural insights with truth SLAM map data      Delivery of stable binary, licensing, and documentation      Delivery of a Phase III transition plan, and Technology roadmap outline         PHASE III:     Phase III develops and produces fieldable prototypes using accepted systems engineering practices to ensure satisfaction of functional requirements and proper management of system configuration. Enable preliminary usage by DoD customers, including DTRA RD-CX and counter-WMD stakeholders. Develop configurations for other DoD systems requiring architecture-aware mapping. Although additional funding may be provided through DoD sources, the awardee should look to other public or private sector funding sources for assistance with transition and commercialization. There is high dual-use potential for this technology that apply to mapping and autonomy in the commercial sector. For example, this technology may be used by commercial robots to perceive their environments or by construction, building   maintenance, and real estate companies to document building layouts and as-built conditions.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE: Develop technologies to maximize performance of lightweight propulsion systems for space-based interceptors.      DESCRIPTION: This topic seeks propulsion system technologies for axial systems and/or divert and attitude control systems (DACS). The proposed propulsion systems must be capable of surviving the high radiation environment and temperature swings experienced in of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for at least 5 years. This topic does not specify propellant or fuel/oxidizer type beyond service life and performance capability considerations.  Hydrazine based monopropellants and bi-propellants are the current state of the art highest performance propellants.  This topic desires technologies that increase performance of hydrazine-based systems or disruptive new technologies that surpass them.  For example, solutions could minimize inert mass or enable use of mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON) compositions with low nitric oxide mass fractions to maximize performance.  Disruptive solutions could be new chemistries or propulsion designs that dramatically surpass existing performance.  Key performance metrics include propellant mass fraction, specific impulse, high thrust to weight ratio, short ignition delay, long duration duty cycles, low minimum impulse bit, and ability to maintain center of gravity control.      PHASE I: Phase I-like proposals will not be evaluated and will be rejected as nonresponsive.

Proposals focusing on component technologies should demonstrate technology capability early in the period of performance, and enable a path to full system demonstration within 2 years through other efforts if necessary. Demonstration of the system outside of ambient temperatures is not required, but the system must be capable of operating between -20C and 60C. System designs that minimize the unit cost would be preferred.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Work with propulsion system manufacturers/designers to implement the propulsion system with propellant formulation and manufacturing of propulsion system into a full-scale testing of a flight-weight system.

"Additive Manufacturing for Circuitry","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Computing and Software; Advanced Materials; Microelectronics      OBJECTIVE: This topic seeks to develop open-source machine controller software and custom 3D printing toolheads that enable the fabrication and repair of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The goal is to adapt an existing 3D printer (commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or custom built) with open-source software to support PCB printing capabilities, while also developing modular toolheads optimized for conductive material printing and circuit repair. Small businesses responding to this topic should select or develop a 3D printer that supports an open-source software configuration and modify that software to meet the specific needs of PCB fabrication. Prusa’s 3D printer suite serves as an example of a COTS system that is open-source and allows for custom toolheads, but its use is not required. Companies may choose to work with any 3D printer that fits the open-source requirement or, if necessary, develop a new system. The key focus is ensuring an open, adaptable ecosystem where software and hardware work together to enable PCB printing.      DESCRIPTION: The awarded company will develop:       Open-source machine controller software modifications that enhance an existing open-source 3D printer to support PCB fabrication and repair.      Custom toolheads that enable functionalities such as conductive ink printing, pick-and-place operations, and multi-layer PCB production.       Ideally, the solution should support key functionalities, including:       Integration with a confocal scanner for substrate mapping and quality assurance.   Automated detection and repair of conductive printed traces.   Two methods of first-layer substrate detection to ensure precision.   Point-to-point manual circuit repair capability for user intervention.   Substrate alignment and automated path detection for multi-layer PCB fabrication.   CAD/CAM workflow visualization to streamline design iteration and printing processes.   The ability to project scanned height maps onto a conformal surface for accurate PCB production.   Pick-and-place component alignment that automatically adjusts to the substrate.   The ability to switch between the developed machine controller software and an OEM controller, ensuring flexibility in usage.       This solution must be built within an open-source framework, ensuring adaptability and future development. The key requirement is that the system leverages open-source software and includes custom toolheads designed for PCB manufacturing and repair.      PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.      To establish the feasibility of adapting open-source 3D printing systems for PCB fabrication and repair, the Phase I effort will focus on evaluating candidate COTS or custom-built 3D printers that support open-source machine controller software, conducting a technical assessment of integration pathways for multi-functional toolheads, and developing initial software modules to demonstrate control over basic PCB-relevant operations. Deliverables will include a technical feasibility report outlining the selected hardware platform and its suitability for modular toolhead integration, proof-of-concept demonstrations of software-driven motion control adapted for PCB deposition processes, and conceptual designs for toolheads enabling conductive ink deposition and pick-and-place functions. The Phase I work will also include preliminary software architecture documentation, risk analysis for multi-layer PCB printing integration, and an open-source compliance assessment to ensure future scalability. This foundation will validate the technical and operational viability of the proposed system and inform detailed engineering in Phase II.      PHASE II: The outcome of this STTR will be the ability to rapidly design/repair/replace obsolete components to combat obsolescence issues and meet mission objectives as well as provide custom stopgap solutions to an already fragile electronics supply chain. This effort relies heavily on machine controller software development for a specific use case.       Machine controller software exists for similar types of machines, maybe not all of the functionality that is being asked for, however, even though the software is mature, it will need to be tailored and proven to work on the AvMC inhouse machine so development work will be needed.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This technology development could be tailored to be a machine agnostic controller software able to realize the potential of many printed microelectronics machines.

"Mechanics and Control of Autonomous Legged Robotic Systems in Mud","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials, Human-Machine Interfaces, Trusted AI and Autonomy       OBJECTIVE: Successful execution of research and development under this topic will produce a quadruped robot and control architecture that enables faster-than-creep gait in deep muddy environments.   DESCRIPTION: Adaptive off-road autonomous locomotion at speed promises disruptive technological overmatch for the future Army. This end state necessitates robust legged locomotion in unforgiving environments, particularly muddy terrain. Authority over legged locomotion in complex environments, particularly quadruped locomotion, has seen rapid acceleration in recent years. Various techniques for navigating uneven, intricate terrain using model predictive control (MPC) and/or reinforcement learning have been presented, energized by the blooming small autonomous robot market and continued interest in planetary exploration [1-4]. Investigators have even tackled the problem of grasses, vines, and entanglements [5]. It is common to describe the terrain that these novel controllers accommodate as “complex”, and authors will often decompose the definition of complex terrain into uneven, dynamic, uncertain, and deformable environments. Yet most of them fall short of claiming effective navigation of truly muddy terrain, and with good reason. Mud and cohesive soils produce widely varying mechanical behaviors under different conditions [6-8]. Attempts to produce legged robotic systems capable of navigating muddy environments typically rely heavily on feet with a large surface area, and using perception to inform a controller about the outcome of a given foot placement [9, 10]. With a clever choice of foot geometry, this design choice largely minimizes the challenge of modeling intrusion, suction, and slipping on even, shallow mud. Future Army applications will require robust control in uneven and deep muddy environments, the ability to overcome suction effects on the gait, and transition to other terrains. Only very recently have research and engineering groups published early efforts to produce a creep gait in a specific “deep mud” environment [11, 12]. As such, the current state of the art for robotic locomotion in mud propels the robot at a speed in the neighborhood of one body length per minute.    Many opportunities exist to use these young results as a springboard to a more comprehensive understanding of legged locomotion in cohesive soils, particularly in multidisciplinary spaces involving geophysicists, roboticists, and data scientists. Hybrid (nonlinear MPC and reinforcement learning) and hierarchical control leveraging perceptive and proprioceptive feedback must be brought to bear on this problem, employing new insights into the physics of these challenging terrains and the usefulness of data-driven control. Moreover, limb and robot modification via embodied intelligence informed design could offer insight into the morphologies and passive mechanics necessary to produce adaptability in such systems.   Candidate proposals under this topic should, by the end of Phase II, design and implement a novel controller on board a quadrupedal robot capable of traversing muddy environments that produce leg intrusions up to 20% of the leg length. The robot should travel along a path whose distance is at minimum 10 bodylengths at an average speed of 8 bodylengths per minute.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.   Successful applicants should be able to produce a critical mass of preliminary simulation date to demonstrate a thorough and quantitative understanding of structure-soil and fluid-structure-soil interactions associated with gait events in deep mud. Phase I should culminate in a proposed physical robot design for Phase II as well as an in-silico demonstration of a proprioception-only controller rejecting unforeseen perturbations to an 8 body length per minute gait in 20% deep mud. Quantify the efficacy of the novel control architecture against two more traditional baselines.   PHASE II: Successful applicants should provide a physical demonstration of a custom autonomous quadruped robot traversing a minimum 10 body length course with up to 20% leg intrusion into deep mud at an average speed of 8 body lengths per minute. Demonstrate the superiority of the novel control and physical design of the robot against one traditional baseline.

"Long-Range Joint Precision Airdrop System (LR-JPADS)","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI and Autonomy      OBJECTIVE: Enable aerial logistics delivery in anti-aircraft/access-denied (A2/AD) contested environments. It will add propulsion to JPADS to extend the range it can deliver at least 700 lbs. of payload to at least 250 nautical miles.    DESCRIPTION: JPADS is an autonomous aerial delivery system which guides a payload from release to a target on the ground.  This effort dramatically extends the range from 15 miles to 250 miles, which will allow for aerial logistics delivery in A2/AD contested environments.  There is a JPADS 2K and 10K variant; this propulsion unit should be demonstrated on JPADS 2K but show efficient expansibility to JPADS 10K.  No other technology exists today which could provide long-range aerial resupply at a low-cost point.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Direct to Phase II proposals for a cost up to $2,000,000 for an 18-month period of performance.      Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility equivalent to a Phase I project has been met. Documentation can include data, reports, specific measurements, success criteria of a prototype, etc.   (DIRECT TO) PHASE II: Firms should provide a prototype of a fielded-configuration JPADS 2K with an add-on propulsion unit. The prototype must demonstrate the capability to fly at least 250 nautical miles with a payload of at least 700 lbs. The prototype must utilize an engine that the firm shows through a design study that can be used for Long Range JPADS 10K. The current JPADS system is a TRL 9 fielded unit.  Adding a propulsion kit to this does not require inventing a new technology, but rather integrating an existing engine and propeller into the JPADS system.  This should allow a diverse set of companies to deliver a prototype since it does not require a niche understanding of aerial delivery, but rather just electro-mechanical competency.   PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Commercial use-cases include Emergency humanitarian resupply for medical and refugee aid, research and fly-over data collection in areas where aircraft is too expensive or not permitted, resupply for wildfire firefighters and remote offshore mining.

"VCSELs for Quantum Sensors","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Quantum Science (including Encryption & Computing); Microelectronics (ME)      OBJECTIVE: This project will develop and qualify application-specific vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for use in quantum sensors and clocks (qVCSELs).      DESCRIPTION: Quantum sensors (qSensors), including atomic magnetometers and clocks, provide essential capabilities across the DOD, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), command, control, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C5ISR), remote sensing, and imaging. Over the past two decades, evolution of micro-mechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication techniques, combined with advances in opto-electronics and microwave electronics, have enabled a new generation of battery-powered “chip-scale” atomic clocks (CSAC) and magnetometers (CSAM). The new generation of chip-scale qSensors enable disruptive capabilities across large ensembles of devices in challenging environments.      Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) are essential to the operation and performance of chip-scale qSensors. VCSELs are primarily utilized for short-haul data communications but have also found wide use in IR illumination and range finding applications. VCSELs for qSensors, “qVCSELs,” represent a tiny slice of the VCSEL market, compared to the large commodity applications, but have far stricter performance requirements. To date, qSensor manufacturers have succeeded with minor modifications to commodity VCSEL designs, combined with extensive testing and screening, to select those VCSELs with suitable noise properties to support qSensor performance.      This program seeks to develop qVCSELs specifically designed and optimized for qSensor applications by specification and design.      Considering differing requirements for atomic clocks vs. magnetometers, as well as two possible atomic species, cesium vs. rubidium, four different qVCSELs are sought, though proposers may address any or all of the variants. Specifications for the four variant qVCSELs are included in Appendix A.1 and A.2. Proposals for a single device that addresses two applications, e.g. rubidium clock and magnetometer, are encouraged but not required.      PHASE I: In order to qualify for this DPII program, the proposer must have a demonstrated ability to design, fabricate, and test electrically-pumped single-transverse-mode GaAs and AlGaAs VCSELs. Preference will be given to those proposers who provide documentation and delivery of VCSEL devices to qSensor manufacturers and of performance data of those VCSELs and qSensors. It is not necessary that the proposer have developed techniques to measure VCSEL performance metrics at the levels required by this solicitation but, in this case, the development of the necessary metrology must be included in the project plan.       PHASE II: In the first 12 months of the program, the vendor will design, fabricate, and test devices to compliance against one or more of the qVCSEL specifications in Appendix A.1 and/or Appendix A.2. The vendor will provide a test report showing measurements of all parameters, except lifetime, for a minimum of 5 devices and will deliver these same 5 prototype devices to the government for independent evaluation.      The vendor will provide samples qVCSELs to one or more vendors of qSensors and facilitate demonstration of compliant qSensor performance utilizing the vendor’s qVCSELs. If additional funding is required to support the vendor this must be included in the program budget.   After 18 months, the vendor will submit a report documenting performance of a minimum of 5 of the latest prototype devices against each specification and deliver these same 5 devices to the government for independent evaluation. The vendor will submit qSensor performance data, measured by the collaborating qSensor vendor(s) demonstrating performance equivalent or superior to that obtained with legacy VCSELs.       If sufficient performance is demonstrated at the conclusion of the 18-month period, the vendor will then provide within a 12-month period life-testing of the qVCSELs, iteration of the device design/manufacture/test as necessary, and release to production. At the conclusion of the period of performance, the vendor will provide a final report to the government, including production statistics on no less than 100 devices, measured against all specifications, as well as life test report demonstrating the expected lifetime of the qVCSEL. The vendor will provide 10 qVCSELs of the final design to the government for independent evaluation.      At the conclusion of Phase 2 period of performance, it is expected that the vendor will make available for sale one or more qVCSEL devices meeting one or more of the qVCSEL requirements of Appendix A.1 and/or Appendix A.2. It is expected that the qVCSELs will have been qualified to meet all specifications at delivery, including lifetime. Phase II Base amount must not exceed $2,095,000 for a 30-month period of performance       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:    This technology can be used for multiple military technologies such as magnetic anomaly detection or magnetic navigation but has a dual use for medical applications such as magnetoencephalography or magnetocardiography.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a multi-channel coherent optical amplifier on a photonic integrated circuit      DESCRIPTION: Quantum computers, certain arrayed quantum sensors, and directed energy laser weapons all share a common need for scalable laser amplification to support multiple laser beams. In the case of quantum computers, optically active qubits require up to one mW per qubit and needs millions if not eventually billions of qubits which translates into kW to MW of optical power separated into many parallel beams[1]. In the case of quantum sensors, atom interferometers, Rydberg sensors, and some magnetometers, a laser system that can generate of order 100 mW each for 4 to 10 laser beams would significantly reduce systems complexity, size, and cost. Finally, for directed energy lasers, a significant scaling parameter is the number of parallel amplified channels, typically greater than 10, that can be made within cost and size constraints [2].         In this topic, proposers should generate a size and manufacturing efficient (scalable) approach to generate 8 laser beams that are coherent with each other from a common seed laser. Each channel shall have a noise figure of less than 5 dB and gain of 20 dB The system should allow for each channel to be independent frequency controlled within 10 GHz from a common seed laser. In this topic “on-chip” means that the light is contained in guided modes in a planar fabricated structure allowing for hybrid or heterogenous integration of multiple chips as needed. The operating wavelength can be at any particular wavelength between 1600 and 500 nm, however, a convincing case should be made that the underlying design concept is extendable to cover other select wavelengths over that range.      PHASE I: In order to qualify for this direct to Phase 2 SBIR, the performer must have a demonstrated capability to fabricate optical amplifiers on chip with exp data supporting the goals of this topic (Gain, size, and noise figure). Additionally, the proposer should have a design for extending a single amplifier to the multi-channel amplifier in this topic.       PHASE II: Build and demonstrate the 8-channel amplifier on-chip prototype described above1. 20 dB gain for each channel, <5 dB noise figure, phase coherent with an input seed laser, all on chip, with fiber outputs for each channel and inputs for seed laser. The packaged multichannel amp should be 100 cubic centimeters and operate at a select wavelength between 1600 and 500 nm. The proposed design should be convincingly scalable to 64 channels, though not demonstrated in this SBIR. The amplifier should be manufacturable by fabrication facilities that can support the commercialization of the amplifier. Phase II Base amount must not exceed $2,095,000 for a 27-month period of performance       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This device is expected to commercially viable immediately after phase II for multiple applications in the private sector such as multi-beam Lidar, and telecommunications, It is envisioned that a second iteration could make purpose built variants of this amplifier for Directed Energy and multiple quantum applications including quantum computing and sensing which are also dual use.

" Integration of Wave Relay API Features into the Thales InterSense IS-1500 Visual Inertial Tracking Software)","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Integrated Network Systems-of-Systems      The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR),   22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services,   including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts   730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs),   their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW)   tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are   advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under   US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE:    DTRA seeks a software solution which uses the Persistent Systems Wave Relay API and SDK to   integrate RF signal information such as Time of Flight (ToF), Time Distance of Arrival (TDoA), and   Asymmetrical Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging (ADS-TDR) into the Thales InterSense IS-1500 Visual   Inertial Tracking software to provide an improved local positioning solution for uncrewed and worn   sensors during tactical operations. The Thales InterSense IS-1500 software uses inertial and visual   technologies to affect local positioning; however, IMU’s are prone to error accumulation over time and   visual tracking is impacted by low light conditions and other environmental complexities [1]. Persistent   Systems Wave Relay MANET radios are used extensively within DTRA and the greater CBRN/CWMD   community for sensor communications and the Wave Relay API provides data which can be used to   enhance current inertial and optical tracking devices. Attempts to use RF signal data have limitations due   to signal strength and interference [2]. The Wave Relay wave form provides up to 10 watts of power   using 3 chain Multi-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) and mesh networking, offering a solution to both   signal strength and interference limitations. Fusing the existing visual and inertial data with the Wave   Relay signal information would provide a more reliable and accurate local positioning solution in GPS   denied and contested areas. This solution would provide accurate positioning for CBRN sensors in   manned and unmanned search operations. This technology would be integrated into the TAK North Star   Plug-in, providing any Wave Relay and IS-1500 user with a robust local positioning solution.      DESCRIPTION:    The technology should use the Wave Relay API and SDK to determine which variables to leverage and   how to integrate them into the existing IS-1500 software. The solution should be integrated into the TAK   North Star Plug-in. The solution should provide accuracy within 1 meter in an area 300 meters by 300   meters without reliance on GPS/GNSS during periods of darkness. The final product should be   integrated into the TAK North Star Plug-in as a capability available for any user with the appropriate   hardware (End User Device, MPU5 Wave Relay Radio, and IS-1500).      PHASE I:    Demonstrate 1 meter accuracy throughout a 300-meter by 300-meter area. The testable area should be complex (non-line of sight) requiring RF repeater nodes to affect communications.      The solution should be dynamic, meaning multiple users should be able to achieve 1 meter accuracy simultaneously. The accuracy should not degrade or drift over time beyond 1 meter. The Phase I deliverable should be a prototype software for the IS-1500 Visual Inertial Sensor.      The technology should integrate into the users TAK system; End User Device, IS-1500, CBRN Sensor, and MPU5 Wave Relay Radio.      Initial testing of the prototype should be conducted, and results should be documented and provided in the final report.      A demonstration should be provided for DTRA government representative, and a plan should also be submitted outlining the approach for Phase II if required.      PHASE II:    Refine the technology IAW the sponsor/end user feedback      Integrate the latest Wave Relay API      Perform maritime testing      Perform subterranean testing      Investigate performance in extreme/limited coms environments where communication is intermittent or lost for up to 5 minutes      Provide 3 IS-1500 units with the software solution to DTRA for testing      Provide Software to TAK Product Center for validation      Provide a demonstration to government representatives      Provide a final report, documentation, and user guides         PHASE III:    Further develop the technology based on the DTRA feedback to improve accuracy and resilience   A final release of software with a continuous modernizations strategy with maintains currency with TAK Product Center, Wave Relay, IS-1500, and Android OS      Although additional funding may be provided through DoD sources, the awardee should look to other public or private sector funding sources for assistance with transition and commercialization.

"Low Cost Interceptors for Missile Defense","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Hypersonics; Emerging Threat Reduction      The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE: Develop design concepts for a low cost missile interceptor and conduct mission analysis to determine the warfighter utility of the concepts against a range of threat missiles.      DESCRIPTION: This topic seeks to complete the detailed design of a low cost interceptor (LCI) to supplement legacy missile defense systems and provide low cost options to help rebalance the offense/defense cost disparity.  In order to effectively defend against large scale attacks from low cost, supersonic cruise missiles (SCM), short- and medium-range ballistic missiles (SRBM, MRBM), and hypersonic glide vehicles (HGV), the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is looking for options to demonstrate LCIs ($350-$700 K per interceptor) capable of fielding in large quantities.  MDA is looking for concepts which utilize Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components and supply chains, weapon open system architecture standards, previously developed subsystems, and rapid, low cost manufacturing practices to provide interceptor options which may offer slightly reduced performance in exchange for greatly decreased unit costs.  Operationally, the same aggregated probability of kill (Pk) may be achieved by firing more, lower-performing LCIs per target than would be required using legacy interceptors, while still achieving a much lower total cost per kill.   The LCI concepts for this topic should be modular in design with weapon open system architectures to permit substitution or spiral improvements of different sensors, effectors or booster components from multiple vendors in follow-on development efforts to expand the mission space of the LCI to additional threats or alternate engagement mechanisms.  The baseline design should be capable of endo-atmospheric engagements, at a maximum range of 100-300 km from the launcher with additional engagement envelope if appropriate.  The LCI must be capable of receiving in-flight updates and possess sufficient speed and maneuverability to intercept airborne targets.  More detailed performance metrics will be provided at the SECRET level after contract award. The physical dimensions of the missiles should permit it to be loaded in the M903A2 launcher or quad-packed into a MK41 Vertical Launch System but the integration is not part of this scope of work.   Phase II awards under this topic will prioritize rapid execution with a maximum period of performance of 18 months.  Faster execution is encouraged where appropriate.  The mission analysis required under this effort will result in SECRET classified data, therefore appropriate facility and personnel clearances will be required to execute this topic.      PHASE I: Phase I-like proposals will not be evaluated and will be rejected as nonresponsive. For this topic, the Government expects the small business would have accomplished the following in a Phase I-like effort via some other means, e.g., independent research and development (IRAD) or other source, a concept for a workable prototype or design to address, at a minimum, the basic capabilities of the stated objective above. Proposal must show, as appropriate, a demonstrated technical feasibility or nascent capability. The documentation provided must substantiate the proposer’s development of a preliminary understanding of the technology to be applied in their Phase II proposal in meeting topic objectives.   Documentation should comprise all relevant information including, but not limited to, technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results. Feasibility = maturity and what have you already done/validated.   Proposers interested in participating in Direct to Phase II must include in their responses to this topic Phase I feasibility documentation that substantiates the scientific and technical merit and Phase I feasibility described in Phase I above has been met.   (i.e., the small business must have performed a proof of concept like “Phase I” component and/or other validation in a relevant environment, and/or at a much higher TRL level (5 or higher) and describe the potential commercialization applications. The documentation provided must validate that the proposer has completed development of technology in previous work or research completed.)   IRAD work: Documentation should include the most relevant information including, but not limited to: technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and/or performance goals/results. Work submitted within the feasibility documentation must have been substantially performed by the proposer and/or the principal investigator (PI).      PHASE II: The threshold level of performance for this phase is to develop a detailed design for a low cost interceptor, conduct engagement modeling and simulation analysis against a range of threat classes to demonstrate the mission effectiveness of the proposed LCI concept, and provide a plan for completing the development, manufacture, testing and demonstration of the concept within 18 additional months, including a proposed schedule and cost.     The detailed design must describe at a minimum: all major subsystems including, but not limited to, boosters, controls, flight computers, communications, fire control interface, terminal seeker, and warhead, sufficiently detailed that the company can begin prototype construction.  The launch interface should be defined including physical and network connections.  The system design must use non-proprietary interfaces between the subsystems (subject to government approval) to permit the substitution of alternate components for the major subsystems listed above, produced by other vendors, in a subset of future spiral designs.  (I.e alternate warheads, terminal seekers, etc.)  If the concept design maturity supports further development, then the objective goal for this phase is to continue the development of the LCI concept beyond the design stage to include prototyping, ground test and/or flight test of the LCI.  The proposal should include the maximum level of maturation the offeror can provide with the available funds.   The kinematic, sensor, control, and warhead performance of the LCI design shall be used to conduct modeling and simulation of engagements against multiple threat missiles in multiple engagement scenarios for each to determine the Pk of the LCI for each case.  The threat missiles shall include, at a minimum; SCM, SRBM, MRBM and HGV and the simulations should include engagements ranging from point defense to protecting targets 10 - 100 km from the LCI launcher at multiple altitudes.  Objectively, the modeling and simulation should include maneuvering target missiles and cooperative intercepts using multiple LCIs to counter the maneuvering and targeting uncertainty.   Three months before the end of the period of performance, the offeror should provide a proposal for completing the development, prototyping, testing and demonstration of the LCI.  The proposal should include a schedule and a cost estimate to complete all remaining development and testing work, culminating in providing 2 demonstration interceptors for government use in interception tests.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Missile Defense Agency is looking to conduct a technology capability demonstration of the LCI to support potential transition to a program of record for integration and fielding.  The completion of this effort would provide a mature design that can rapidly transition into prototyping, test and demonstration.  Selection for a Phase 3 award will be based on a best value judgement on the expected utility of the interceptor vs. the cost for development and acquisition, interest from legacy missile defense system program offices which would transition the interceptor, and the availability of funds.

"Multi-Fuel Platoon Power Generator","    OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials, Mission Readiness & Disaster Preparedness, Sustainment & Logistics      OBJECTIVE: The topic aims to fulfill the need for a Platoon Scale Power Generator (PPG) that will allow Platoons to operate semi-independently over extended periods of time and distance during Large Scale Combat Operations (LSCO).  PPG is one part of the Platoon’s overall power generation capabilities. It will convert an energy source, such as fossil fuels and/or alternative fuels, to electric power, to charge and recharge large quantities of a Platoon’s batteries quickly and efficiently.  This will minimize the need for support from higher echelons thus, greatly reducing logistical burdens of power and battery related resupply.  PPG will reduce the need for the Platoon to carry large quantities of extra batteries.      DESCRIPTION: The PPG will meet the following requirements:   The system shall produce >1.5 kW of continuous output power    When in operation, the system’s fuel source shall have an energy density of 500-2000 Wh/kg    PPG shall provide either 120VAC or 28VDC (T) and 240VAC (O) at a frequency of 60 Hertz    The system shall not exceed 55lbs. (T).  The goal is to minimize the system weight below 20 lbs without fuel    System shall be able to operate in parallel with ≥two (2) systems, same model, output, and mode, (T) and up to four (4) systems of same or different types, models, outputs and modes, (O) together to produce greater power and increase overall system reliability   PPG can be optimized to operate on one fuel type or be capable of operating on multiple fuels.  Where applicable, consider operation on DoD approved lubricants and standard military fuels such as JP-8, F-24. DF2 or alternative fuels to include, but not limited to methanol, methanol-water mixture, ALANE (AIH3), High Energy Aluminum (HEA), or Activated Aluminum   The volume of the PPG shall be between 2 – 10 cubic feet   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.      Demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed Platoon Power Generator technology. Identify the technology, fuel choice, along with supporting information. Develop the overall system design, model the size and weight of the system, component choices and sources and perform a comparative analysis of the design metrics with incumbent generator solutions and other technology/fuel implementations from literature. Provide a report on the findings.      PHASE II: Further develop and demonstrate the Platoon Power Generator designed in Phase I.  Performers will source and/or build and test key components of the system leading to the demonstration of a TRL 4 breadboard system during phase II performance. Upon a successful demonstration at TRL 4, refinements will be made to improve the system design and address any findings from the breadboard demonstration. Two functional systems will be delivered to the Army for evaluation at the end of the Phase II effort to support 100 hours of testing each, at the nominal power output of the system.      PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:   The generator market is currently a $35.9 billion industry and is expected to grow to $53.5 billion industry by 2032*.

"Mechanics and Control of Autonomous Legged Robotic Systems in Mud","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials, Human-Machine Interfaces, Trusted AI and Autonomy       OBJECTIVE: Successful execution of research and development under this topic will produce a quadruped robot and control architecture that enables faster-than-creep gait in deep muddy environments.   DESCRIPTION: Adaptive off-road autonomous locomotion at speed promises disruptive technological overmatch for the future Army. This end state necessitates robust legged locomotion in unforgiving environments, particularly muddy terrain. Authority over legged locomotion in complex environments, particularly quadruped locomotion, has seen rapid acceleration in recent years. Various techniques for navigating uneven, intricate terrain using model predictive control (MPC) and/or reinforcement learning have been presented, energized by the blooming small autonomous robot market and continued interest in planetary exploration [1-4]. Investigators have even tackled the problem of grasses, vines, and entanglements [5]. It is common to describe the terrain that these novel controllers accommodate as “complex”, and authors will often decompose the definition of complex terrain into uneven, dynamic, uncertain, and deformable environments. Yet most of them fall short of claiming effective navigation of truly muddy terrain, and with good reason. Mud and cohesive soils produce widely varying mechanical behaviors under different conditions [6-8]. Attempts to produce legged robotic systems capable of navigating muddy environments typically rely heavily on feet with a large surface area, and using perception to inform a controller about the outcome of a given foot placement [9, 10]. With a clever choice of foot geometry, this design choice largely minimizes the challenge of modeling intrusion, suction, and slipping on even, shallow mud. Future Army applications will require robust control in uneven and deep muddy environments, the ability to overcome suction effects on the gait, and transition to other terrains. Only very recently have research and engineering groups published early efforts to produce a creep gait in a specific “deep mud” environment [11, 12]. As such, the current state of the art for robotic locomotion in mud propels the robot at a speed in the neighborhood of one body length per minute.    Many opportunities exist to use these young results as a springboard to a more comprehensive understanding of legged locomotion in cohesive soils, particularly in multidisciplinary spaces involving geophysicists, roboticists, and data scientists. Hybrid (nonlinear MPC and reinforcement learning) and hierarchical control leveraging perceptive and proprioceptive feedback must be brought to bear on this problem, employing new insights into the physics of these challenging terrains and the usefulness of data-driven control. Moreover, limb and robot modification via embodied intelligence informed design could offer insight into the morphologies and passive mechanics necessary to produce adaptability in such systems.   Candidate proposals under this topic should, by the end of Phase II, design and implement a novel controller on board a quadrupedal robot capable of traversing muddy environments that produce leg intrusions up to 20% of the leg length. The robot should travel along a path whose distance is at minimum 10 bodylengths at an average speed of 8 bodylengths per minute.   PHASE I: This topic is accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.   Successful applicants should be able to produce a critical mass of preliminary simulation date to demonstrate a thorough and quantitative understanding of structure-soil and fluid-structure-soil interactions associated with gait events in deep mud. Phase I should culminate in a proposed physical robot design for Phase II as well as an in-silico demonstration of a proprioception-only controller rejecting unforeseen perturbations to an 8 body length per minute gait in 20% deep mud. Quantify the efficacy of the novel control architecture against two more traditional baselines.   PHASE II: Successful applicants should provide a physical demonstration of a custom autonomous quadruped robot traversing a minimum 10 body length course with up to 20% leg intrusion into deep mud at an average speed of 8 body lengths per minute. Demonstrate the superiority of the novel control and physical design of the robot against one traditional baseline.

"Mode-Locked Lasers on Chip toward Frequency Combs and Quantum Applications    ","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Quantum Science (including Encryption & Computing); Directed Energy      OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a model locked laser on chip that is extendable to an octave spanning stabilized frequency comb suitable for atomic clock frequency division and quantum technology laser frequency control      DESCRIPTION: Optical frequency combs are a critical enabling component for the functioning of optical atomic clocks, and also an important enabler for other quantum technology because combs can simplify the control of laser based systems and make them more robust to the environment with improved frequency control properties [1]. Existing frequency combs are based on mode locked lasers using doped fiber, however these are larger, power hungry, and costly devices that are limiting the advancement of quantum technology into smaller more useful form factors. A separate, chip scale approach using ring resonators has been studied extensively, but failed to deliver capability because of fabrication constraints and tight tolerances specific to that approach as well as producing limited optical power.      This topic will develop a mode locked laser on chip that will combine the robustness of the fiber laser approach and the miniaturization and fabrication advantages of photonics integrated circuits (PICs) [2]. The goal is to demonstrate a mode locked laser using PICs that is compatible with a fully on chip, optical frequency comb that is capable of coherent frequency division. Phase 1 will generate a design and model suitable for fabrication of a mode locked laser on chip and Phase II will demonstrate that design as a prototype.       In this proposal “on chip” means that the light is contained in guided modes in a planar fabricated structure allowing for hybrid or heterogenous integration of multiple chips as needed.      PHASE I: Develop a design and device operation model ready for immediate fabrication preferably in facilities meant more for commercial use than pure research. It is expected that this design will need to be improved in Phase 2 with spiral development. The design should further identify, at least conceptually, how the MLL can be extended in the future to create chip-scale, fully stabilized, optical frequency comb. The design should include an on-chip device that can stabilize the cavity length and/or repetition rate of the MLL. The target performance parameters are 200 femtosecond pulse width, and 10 mW average power output, in a 30 cubic centimeter package (not including drive electronics).        The model should capture all of the relevant physics of the design including realistic fabrication tolerances, roughness, and material quality expected in the fabrication process designed for. The phase 1 deliverable is a report detailing the model and design. Phase I Base amount must not exceed $314,363 for a 12-month period of performance.       Proposers interested in submitting a Direct to Phase II proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described in the Phase I section above has been met.      PHASE II: Deliver a MLL chip scale prototype that is packaged with fiber outputs suitable for testing with an optical spectrum analyzer and frequency-resolved optical grating (FROG). The MLL should be capable of self-starting into a stable and repeatable mode with a consistent number of solitons. The fluence and power should be consistent with Phase 1 design concept to generate. The pulse repetition rate should be greater than 100 MHz (such that power requirements are reasonably minimized) and less than 20 GHz (such that on-chip photodetectors can generate microwave signals without special microwave circuits). The average power output shall be greater than 10 mW, the and the pulse width less than 200 femtoseconds. The packaged prototype should be less than 30 cubic centimeters (excluding drive electronics). Phase II Base amount must not exceed $2,095,000 for a 24-month period of performance.       PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This device is expected to commercially viable quickly. It should form the foundation of the next generation of optical atomic clocks and the control of optically based quantum sensors and quantum computers. Also, MLL can be used for many non-quantum applications such as optical communications, photonic RF technology, LIDAR, and some directed energy and fabrication uses [1]. There are many potential DoD applications that could use these devices in a Phase III after this Phase II.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE:    Develop computational modeling tools to characterize and quantify the environments inside an armored vehicle exposed to a conventional blast, inert metal, or shaped charge weapon. The tools should predict environments with sufficient detail to predict blast overpressure, blunt trauma, penetration, inhalation, and burn injuries resulting from weapons designed to injure or kill armored vehicle occupants. In combination with related computational blast injury modeling activities, this project will provide supporting information to answer questions from the battalion commanders and the command surgeons regarding the   type and severity of injuries that may occur in a ground combat environment.      DESCRIPTION:    The proposed computational tools should provide objective quantification of the interior environments to which vehicle occupants would be exposed as a function of time, under conditions of lateral or underbody explosive weapons, shaped charges, explosively formed projectiles, and dense inert projectiles. The proposer should identify approaches for validating the proposed model and for using high-fidelity modeling to generate fast-running algorithms capable of approximating high-fidelity model predictions.      PHASE I:    In Phase I, a high-fidelity modeling framework should be demonstrated on shaped charge weapons using a defined vehicle (armored or unarmored). In addition to the demonstrated modeling capability, during Phase I the respondent will provide a technical approach for simulating the effects of both shaped charges and high explosive weapons detonated laterally to the vehicle. Finally, during Phase I, the contractor will   identify sources of data or data collection methods for validating the high-fidelity model      PHASE II:    In Phase II, the proposer will provide high-fidelity modeling capability for predicting the interior   environments created by high explosive blasts, shaped charges/explosively formed projectiles, and dense inert projectiles on a range of armored and unarmored vehicles. The high-fidelity model will be used to generate fast-running algorithms that approximate the results of the high-fidelity model. The user will work with Government personnel and other contractors to locate and utilize existing data with which to validate the high-fidelity model.      PHASE III:    The program will generate a computational software. The major customers will be US military command surgeons and combat commanders. Later stage, the product could be used by NATO partners. There is no intention for civilian application in the future.

"Droppable Chemical Warfare Agent Sensor","OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Integrated Sensing and Cyber      The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.      OBJECTIVE:    DTRA seeks to develop and demonstrate a lightweight, droppable chemical warfare agent sensor capable   of real-time detection, identification, and geolocation of chemical threats.      DESCRIPTION:    CBRN Technical Forces employ the Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) to provide individual CWA detection and alerting in real-time during operations in potentially contaminated environments. However, given the JCAD’s weight, power, and lack of native mesh networking capability, it is not an optimal sensor to employ from individuals or uncrewed systems [1]. The droppable chemical agent detection sensor is an ultra-compact, low SWaP, device designed to provide real-time detection, identification, and mapping of chemical warfare agents and VOC’s in operational environments. Engineered for deployment by aerial or ground uncrewed vehicles and individual personnel, the sensors provide rapid hazard awareness for technical forces. Once deployed, each sensor continuously monitors the environment, autonomously analyzing air samples and providing immediate detection alerts. Upon detection, the sensor generates geolocated data, automatically pushing its detection results and environmental metadata into ATAK.      Through embedded wireless mesh networking capability, the sensors create a resilient, scalable, detection grid, allowing the information or real-time hazard maps that update dynamically as threat presence change. Data is transmitted using Cursor-On-Target messages, enabling seamless interoperability with ATAK clients, WebTAK, WinTAK, and TAK servers. Sensor status, detection, and locations are visualized directly on the ATAK map, allowing users to rapidly assess affected areas and informing operational decisions.      Requirements for this development are as follows:      Drop Sensor SWaP:      Utilizes Nanopore Technology 512 Channel MinION Flow Cell      <2.5” diameter, <1” height      Weight = <2.5 oz.      Scalable employment options for UAS employment      Capable of identifying a range of CWA and TIC; response time < 5 minutes      48-hour battery life, extendable sleep mode option      Geolocated outputs; each detection tagged with GPS coordinates      Mesh Networking; multiple sensors interconnect to expand coverage and maintain communication in denied communications environments      Integration into the ATAK CBRNPI utilizing ProtoBuff programming language partnered with a DTRA-approved ATAK CBRNPI Developer      Drop-tested to MIL-STD-810G for ruggedization         PHASE I:    Candidate chemical detection technologies (e.g., miniaturized IMS, colorimetric arrays, electrochemical sensors) will be evaluated and down-selected based on sensitivity, size, and power considerations. Bench- top testing against chemical simulants will be conducted to validate early performance. Sensor modules will be designed, integrating detection elements, GPS geolocation, a mesh networking architecture, and initial COT messaging capabilities for ATAK integration. Networking feasibility will be demonstrated through a mesh network of multiple units, with CoT message transmission to a TAK client. Additionally, an initial hazard mapping concept will be developed to model threat zones. Phase I will conclude with a feasibility report, a detailed prototype design package, and a refined Phase II development plan.      PHASE II:    Field and demonstrate fully functional, ruggedized drop sensor prototypes. Focus on integrating advanced detection technologies with a compact, MIL-STD-810G-certified enclosure, achieving long operational life (>72hours) on battery power. Chemical sensing capabilities will be expanded to cover CWAs with improved detection thresholds, validated through laboratory and live agent testing. Mesh networking capabilities will be enhanced with self-forming, self-healing protocols, supporting both peer-to-peer communications and data relay to TAK clients or servers via PyTAK. Hazard field interpolation algorithms will be finalized and implemented into custom ATAK visualization layers for real-time hazard mapping, complete with gradient concentration displays. Multiple prototypes will be fabricated and   deployed in operationally relevant condition, supporting a full range of DoD CBRN missions.       PHASE III:    This phase will further develop the capability developed in Phase II by improving robustness and user application. Although additional funding may be provided through DoD sources, the awardee should look to other public or private sector funding sources for assistance with transition and   commercialization.

Access the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database (https://seer.cancer.gov/) for more information regarding 5-year cancer survival rates.  Because of smaller patient populations and challenging development pathways, development of new technologies focused on pediatric and rare cancers lag significantly compared to other major cancers. Innovative and transformative solutions focused on prevention, diagnosis, detection, and treatment in both pediatric cancers and rare cancers are urgently needed. Rather than just the tried and tested approaches that have not led to much success and progress, bold and “out of the box” ideas that are still based on sound scientific premise are needed to make a significant impact in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with pediatric and/or rare cancer. Thus, the NCI SBIR Development Center has developed the NCI SBIR Innovative Concept Award program to encourage the development of high-risk innovative and disruptive technologies.  The Concept Award program will provide funding to small businesses to explore the technical feasibility and demonstrate proof of concept for the development of highly innovative therapies, devices, diagnostic tools, or preventive strategies focused on pediatric and rare cancers.

Innovative and transformative solutions focused on prevention, diagnosis, detection, and treatment in both pediatric cancers and rare cancers are urgently needed. Rather than just the tried and tested approaches that have not led to much success and progress, bold and “out of the box” ideas that are still based on sound scientific premise are needed to make a significant impact in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with pediatric and/or rare cancer. Thus, the NCI SBIR Development Center has developed the NCI SBIR Innovative Concept Award program to encourage the development of high-risk innovative and disruptive technologies.  The Concept Award program will provide funding to small businesses to explore the technical feasibility and demonstrate proof of concept for the development of highly innovative therapies, devices, diagnostic tools, or preventive strategies focused on pediatric and rare cancers. The focus is on innovation and “out of the box” ideas that have not been tried and tested before. So, preliminary data is not required; however, proposed ideas should have sound scientific premise either based on the offeror’s own research or referenced literature evidence. Offerors are eligible to apply if they have disruptive ideas based on sound scientific premise with a potential to make an impact in these cancers. The goal of the funding is for offerors to generate de-risking technical data that provides key proof of concept validation. We also want the offerors to explore the commercial potential and development path of the technology during the award period. In addition to funding, the program will also provide additional business and commercialization resources including entrepreneurship training to explore and refine the business model and commercialization plan.  Device Development Projects: The offeror could propose most or all of these activities for pediatric or rare cancers. • Evaluation and justification of clinical need • Product concept and protype development • Early feasibility studies • Phantom validation • In vivo validation studies • Software development (if needed) • Biocompatibility, sterility, and safety studies Diagnostics Development Projects: The offeror could propose most or all of these activities for pediatric or rare cancers. • Biomarker discovery and biomarker optimization • Assay development and optimization • Define assay performance and analytic validation • Sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility • Validation studies in PDX samples or clinical samples  ",2,"Phase I",SBIR,HHS,NIH,"September 26, 2025","April 15, 2025","June 4, 2025",https://sam.gov/opp/75237c3988b24edbbbfc9751ef7eba7f/view,Closed,2025,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/12005
"NHLBI SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Awards to Accelerate the Commercialization of Technologies for Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders and Diseases (R44 Clinical Trial Optional)","Since its inception in 1982, the NIH SBIR program has provided the small business community with seed funding to support the development of a broad array of commercial products to detect, diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. It provides an important funding mechanism for bringing new interventions to patients and clinicians. The SBIR program is structured in three phases. The objective in Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of a proposed research and development (R&D) effort, while in Phase II it is to continue the R&D effort for successful Phase I projects. The expectation is that in Phase III, a Small Business Concern (SBC) will be able to launch a product commercially with non-SBIR funds. However, many projects initiated with SBIR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR Phase II award to complete the validation studies required to obtain regulatory approval and launch a product. In particular, the development of therapeutics, medical devices, and combined technologies often requires a number of years and substantial capital investments because of the costs associated with conducting clinical trials and/or other steps mandated by the Federal regulatory approval process. Companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive at preclinical or early clinical stages of development to investors and strategic partners. In addition, many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically diverse patient populations. Thus, despite the extensive R&D performed on such products during Phase II projects, the results are often insufficient to attract the substantial private investment needed for the eventual commercialization of the product. Many small businesses therefore become cash-starved before reaching the next critical milestone along the path toward commercialization. Hence, this NOFO is designed to address this funding gap between the end of the SBIR or STTR Phase II award and the point at which non-SBIR financing can be secured for the subsequent stages of product development. A number of public and private organizations recognize the challenges associated with this funding gap and are taking steps to provide additional resources to advance a greater number of promising early-stage technologies toward commercialization. Importantly, many of these organizations are not only providing financial support but are also establishing programs to provide commercialization guidance. For example, in the area of drug development, a number of major pharmaceutical firms have developed corporate venture funds focused on supporting projects in the preclinical stages of development, and some of these firms have established technology incubators to provide development support, including regulatory guidance. In addition, a growing number of universities are creating venture funds to support innovative technologies developed by their resident investigators, and numerous state-sponsored technology funds have also been created across the U.S. to support start-up companies. In the rare disease area, patient advocacy groups and foundations have organized to accelerate progress in the development of treatments for their disease. Such programs can provide additional financing and commercialization support for SBIR awardees that have received initial seed funding and a rigorous technical evaluation through the NIH peer review process. As such, a major goal of this NOFO is to provide a platform to incentivize partnerships between NIH-funded SBIR awardees and a broad range of potential third-party investors. It is anticipated that funding by third-party investors will be predicated on significant due diligence, thus encouraging awardees to formulate credible business plans for product commercialization. In addition, it is expected that third-party investors will maintain an active role in supporting the awardee during the product development phase and during pursuit of follow-on funding for commercialization.  Specific Objectives for SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award Applications A. Independent Third-Party Investor Funds  This NOFO specifically encourages business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products whose development was initiated with SBIR or STTR funding. Applicants are expected to leverage their previous SBIR or STTR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NHLBI funding under this NOFO, to attract and negotiate third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant’s ability to secure independent third-party investor funds that equal or exceed one-third of the total amount of the NHLBI funds being requested over the entire Phase IIB Small Market Award project period will help to validate the commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR projects proposed under this NOFO. This potential will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. If a Phase IIB Small Market Award application is selected for funding, the applicant’s plan for securing independent third-party investor funds (i.e., the Finance Plan submitted as part of the application) will become a term of award as described in Section VI.1 Award Notices. It is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors will involve a considerable level of project due diligence by the private sector, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. In light of these goals, the NHLBI strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in commercializing emerging biomedical technologies addressing rare diseases or young pediatric populations, as well as engaging with the patient advocacy groups and foundations that focus on the indication of the developing technology. Applicants are encouraged to explore existing resources and groups to engage with the relevant communities, such as the NCATS Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD), the NCATS Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), the NIH Pediatric Research Consortium, the FDA Pediatric Device Consortia Grants Program , FasterCures, and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute(PCORI).  B. Scientific/Technical Scope  The technical and commercial objectives described in the SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award application MUST represent an extension of the development efforts that were pursued in a previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II award. It is essential that significant progress was accomplished during the current/preceding SBIR or STTR Phase II project and that the proposed product has significant commercial potential. Applicants are expected to demonstrate that the proposed product has a clear advantage over existing and/or competing products and to define an appropriate path toward ultimate product commercialization. This NOFO is specifically designed to provide additional support for products that require ultimate approval/clearance by a Federal regulatory agency. Although projects previously funded by another NIH Institute/Center or another Federal agency are eligible for funding under this NOFO, proposed projects MUST be relevant to the NHLBI mission. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the NHLBI to discuss whether their proposed project meets this criterion. The NHLBI supports development of technologies to detect, prevent, or treat cardiovascular, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. It also supports research on the clinical use of blood and all aspects of the management and safety of blood resources. The NHLBI SBIR/STTR program fosters basic, applied, and clinical research on products related to the NHLBI mission. The NHLBI program priority areas for technology development research include but are not limited to those listed below:  Cardiovascular Diseases areas: Diagnostics, therapeutics (including cell and gene therapies), or instruments for treating congenital or acquired heart disease in young pediatric populations, including heart pumps and valves, atrial septal defect closure devices, surgical tools, and devices for cardiac catheterization; diagnostics and therapies for rare arrhythmias (such as LQTS-1, -2, and -3, Brugada's, and Timothy's syndromes) and lipid disorders (such as lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase or lipoprotein deficiencies or genetic diseases such as Pompe disease); technologies, instruments, and therapeutics for heart (and lung) transplantation, including devices for perfusion of donor organs and technologies for less invasive tissue biopsies and detection of organ rejection. Other cardiovascular disease areas may be proposed, as areas of interest are not limited to those listed. Lung Diseases areas: Diagnostics and therapeutics for rare lung diseases and those affecting young pediatric populations, including, but not limited to: respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, adult and pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension, adult and childhood interstitial lung diseases, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and sarcoidosis.

Other lung disease areas may be proposed, as areas of interest are not limited to those listed. Blood Diseases and Resources areas: In vitro diagnostic devices and therapeutic biologics, devices, and drugs for rare diseases, and diseases affecting young children and neonates, including, but not limited to: coagulation and other laboratory based assays; transfusion/infusion and non-transfusion/non-infusion treatments for bleeding complications in acquired and inherited bleeding disorders; point of care diagnostics for Sickle Cell Disease and other hemoglobinopathies to facilitate testing in low resource settings to provide earlier diagnosis and access to medical interventions; devices that facilitate transfusion of small volumes of blood components; and long-term, indwelling catheters for transfusion, blood sample collection or medication administration that provide very low thrombosis/infection risk. Other blood disease and resource areas may be proposed, as areas of interest are not limited to those listed. Examples of appropriate development activities to be proposed under this NOFO include, but are not limited to the following areas:  For projects pertaining to the development of therapeutics - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or clinical studies to support the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) and/or Biological License Application (BLA). For projects pertaining to imaging technologies, interventional devices, and in vivo diagnostics - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of a 510(k) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, or an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. For projects pertaining to ex vivo or in vitro diagnostics, prognostics, and screening tests - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of a 510(k) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and/or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, as needed for the specific technology/system/assay. NHLBI expects that activities to be pursued under this NOFO will address any relevant requirements for clinical validation and regulatory approval, as necessary and required for commercialization of the technology. Specific activities to be proposed will vary among applications. For more information about the areas of science supported by this NOFO, please visit the NHLBI section of https://seed.nih.gov/sites/default/files/HHS_Program_Descriptions.pdf.  NCATS Scientific Areas: NCATS intends to co-fund applications that meet the NCATS mission to develop innovations that reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational science process, to speed the development and delivery of new drugs, diagnostics, medical devices and behavioral interventions to patients. Additionally, NCATS is interested in co-funding applications that address rare diseases, and in particular, that can help speed the development of treatments for multiple rare diseases. As detailed in NOT-TR-18-025, NCATS is limited to direct support of clinical trials through phase IIB with the exception of phase III (21 CFR definition) clinical trials for treatment of a rare disease or condition. For a description of the NCATS SBIR/STTR research priorities, please refer to http://ncats.nih.gov/smallbusiness/priorities. C. Plan for Full Commercialization  The goal of the SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award is to advance SBIR or STTR Phase II projects toward ultimate commercialization. All applicants are expected to describe a realistic plan (extending beyond the SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award project period) that outlines how and when full commercialization can be accomplished. The long-term commercialization strategy should be presented as part of the 12-page Commercialization Plan. The full commercialization plan for the product should extend beyond the period of SBIR funding.  Applicants are encouraged to leverage other available Federal resources where appropriate, including existing FDA incentives to increase and accelerate small market product development, such as Orphan Drug designation, Humanitarian Device Exemption, the Pediatric Exclusivity Provision, and the Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grants Program to assist with expenses related to clinical trials. Additional information about relevant FDA programs and resources may be found on the Developing Products for Rare Diseases & Conditions industry page.

"Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN): Biologic-based Drug Discovery and Development for Disorders of the Nervous System (U44 Clinical Trial Optional)","Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network for Biologics (BPN Biologics) The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research is a collaborative framework through which 13 NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices jointly support neuroscience research, with the aim of accelerating transformative discoveries for the nervous system in health, aging, and disease. For further information, see: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov.  Recent advances in biologics-based therapeutics offer unprecedented opportunities to develop new treatments for nervous/neuromuscular system disorders across multiple emerging modalities, including gene and cell therapies, oligonucleotides, and novel antibody technologies. However, biotherapeutics development has inherent complexities with regard to characterization, manufacturing, delivery, and administration and requires specialized expertise and resources.  The Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network for Biologics (BPN Biologics) program seeks to bridge this gap by providing awarded projects with:  Grant funding for investigator-led discovery and development activities In-kind access to BPN Biologics contract resource organizations (CROs) that specialize in industry-standard manufacturing, nonclinical, and early phase clinical services Assistance from BPN Biologics-contracted consultants with industry expertise across drug development areas and therapeutic modalities Project management support and milestone and strategy planning resources The overarching goal of the program is to accelerate the development of diverse biotherapeutic modalities for the treatment of nervous and neuromuscular system disorders by advancing therapies through early clinical development.   For more information, please visit our website at: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics.  A. Overview The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to support the development of biologics-based therapies for disorders affecting the nervous and neuromuscular systems. Activities supported by this NOFO include lead optimization through first-in-human phase 1 clinical trials. Applicants may propose to use grant funding to conduct all experimental activities or collaborate with BPN Biologics CROs on activities of their choice. The PD/PI will be responsible for conducting all studies involving disease- or target-specific assays, animal models, and other research tools.   This NOFO uses a phased, milestone driven U44 Fast-Track cooperative agreement that involves close collaboration and regular interactions with NIH program staff (see Section VI.2). All projects must have two phases and start with a U44 Phase I award. The U44 Phase I may not exceed two years. Progression from U44 Phase I to Phase II will be based on administrative review and availability of funds (see Section I.H, Milestones). Note: For this NOFO, Phase 1 clinical testing, studies, or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. U44 Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.  As part of the cooperative agreement, a multi-disciplinary and highly collaborative “Lead Development Team” (LDT) composed of the PD/PI’s research team, NIH staff, and NIH-contracted consultants will be assembled for each project. Consultants will be selected by NIH program staff based on the specific expertise needed. The LDT will meet once every two weeks at a fixed time throughout the funding period. Relevant project staff from BPN Biologics CROs will join when appropriate. The LDT will participate in:  Developing the overall project strategy Refining milestone plans and advising on appropriate go/no-go decision criteria Designing study plans to be conducted by BPN Biologics CROs and coordinating activities across research sites Regularly presenting new project-related data and troubleshooting issues as they arise B. Scope Projects must focus on a single nervous or neuromuscular system condition that falls within the mission of participating NIH Blueprint Institutes and Centers (see Section I.C below).  Biologics-based therapeutic agents that are within scope of this program include, but are not limited to, antibodies, peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, gene therapies, cell therapies, and other emerging therapeutic modalities (e.g., microbial or microbiome-based).  Note: This NOFO does not support small molecules drugs (see Companion BPN Funding Opportunities PAR-24-043 and PAR-24-063). Applicants should contact NIH Scientific/Research staff regarding small peptides (less than 6 amino acids), natural products, and/or combination therapies to determine the fit for this NOFO.  C. Institutes and Centers (IC) Interests and Guidance For specific IC requirements and interest statements refer, to the BPN Biologics website at: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics/contacts.  D. Entry Criteria All projects will begin with a U44 Phase I award regardless of therapeutic starting point. Applicants may enter the program at either the “Discovery Stage” after one or more lead biologic agent has been identified or at the “Development Stage” once a single clinical candidate has been selected.  At minimum, all projects entering the program must have a strong body of evidence linking the putative drug target/affected pathway to the proposed disease pathophysiology and compelling data suggesting the proposed mechanism or mode of action is likely to produce desirable outcomes for the intended patient population.    Discovery-stage entry criteria Projects entering at this stage must have:  One or more lead agent(s) that have been sufficiently profiled for lead optimization and require no more than two years of further optimization to select a single clinical candidate Preliminary target engagement data (i.e., target binding or proximal downstream effects) with lead agent(s) in a relevant animal model Preliminary in vivo efficacy data (e.g., histological, functional, and/or behavioral outcomes) with lead agent(s) in a disease relevant animal model Readily available in vitro or ex vivo assays (e.g., binding, bioactivity, selectivity) with sufficient reliability and throughput to drive lead optimization in the PD/PI’s or collaborator’s lab Available animal model(s) that have been sufficiently validated and characterized and are ready for dosing with the proposed lead(s) in the PI/PD or collaborator’s lab No obvious legal (e.g., intellectual property) constraints to pursuing the proposed biologic agent(s), using the proposed assays and models for research purposes, and/or commercial development. If patents have not been filed at this stage, it is expected that a strategy is in place for future IP filings. Development-stage entry criteria  Projects must have selected a single clinical candidate prior to entering the program that:  Requires no further optimization Has suitable pharmacokinetics (for gene and cell therapies, this may include biodistribution/tropism) and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship with the planned route of administration Demonstrated in vivo target engagement and efficacy with defined minimal and optimal doses with the intended route of administration in the relevant animal model(s) Is protected by granted or pending patents and is unlikely blocked or impeded by legal (e.g., intellectual property) constraints E. Activities Supported Through This Program U44 Phase I activities The U44 Phase I award supports lead optimization, candidate selection, and any remaining activities required to initiate Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies. The U44 Phase I award must not exceed two years. Projects entering at the Development stage are expected to complete U44 Phase I activities within one year since they are further advanced.  The following are examples of in-scope U44 Phase I activities for projects entering at the Discovery stage:  Optimization of lead agent(s) to improve bioactivity, selectivity, and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and reduce toxicity Research-grade synthesis of new analogs for in vitro and in vivo testing as part of lead optimization Characterization of identity and properties (e.g., cell phenotype, post-translational modifications, aggregation, epitope mapping, stability) In vivo pharmacology (e.g., dose-range, dosing regimen, treatment duration) In vivo efficacy studies assessing target engagement and functional outcomes in relevant animal model(s) Preliminary safety and tolerability Initial development of bioanalytical assays to measure drug levels in nonclinical and clinical PK studies Initial development of pharmacodynamic biomarkers to measure target engagement or downstream drug effects in nonclinical and clinical studies The following are examples of in-scope U44 Phase I activities for projects entering at the Development stage:  Replication of in vivo efficacy studies in the same or different animal model (if needed) Remaining qualification of bioanalytical assays and pharmacodynamic biomarker assays Pre-formulation studies (e.g., buffer compatibility, freeze-thaw, excipient screening) Initial process development for drug production Initial development of analytical methods (i.e., potency, purity, identity, and safety testing) to monitor quality and consistency of drug substance and drug product manufacturing Pre-IND package preparation and pre-IND meeting U44 Phase II activities: The U44 Phase II award supports completion of safety and pharmacology in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), production of material under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) in support of IND filing, and a first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial. Progression from the U44 Phase I to Phase II award will be based on administrative review of milestones progress (see section I.H, Milestones). After successful completion of the U44 Phase I award, a project may proceed to the U44 Phase II award.  The following are examples of in-scope U44 Phase II activities:  Non-GLP toxicology studies (e.g., dose range finding toxicology) IND-enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology in compliance with GLP Biodistribution and immunogenicity in vivo studies Tumorigenicity evaluations, particularly for gene and cell therapies Master and working cell bank development Manufacture of the candidate therapeutic for IND Formulation and stability studies IND preparation and submission FIH phase 1 clinical trial The goal by the end of the U44 Phase II award is to reach the clinical trial stage (at minimum, IND filing). Applicants are encouraged to include a FIH clinical trial if feasible within the funding period.  Clinical trial activities  FIH clinical trials supported in the U44 Phase II may use:  Healthy subjects or subjects from the intended patient population Single dose or single ascending dose protocols, which may be placebo-controlled or open-label studies Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and target engagement endpoints Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific/Research staff to ensure their proposed clinical trial plan can be supported by the program.  F. Responsible parties for proposed activities PD/PI’s team Applicants may propose to use grant funding to perform all or some of the U44 Phase I and II research activities at the PD/PI’s institution and/or through collaborators/CROs selected and managed by the PD/PI through a sub-award. It is expected that grant funding will be used for the following:  All activities using target- or disease-related assays (e.g., target binding, phenotypic assays, organoids) and animal models (e.g., transgenic, knockout, pharmacologically induced) Assembly and submission of regulatory meeting packages and the IND application. The PD/PI’s institution will be responsible for scheduling regulatory meetings with the FDA. Assistance from NIH-contracted consultants will be available to support preparation of regulatory materials. BPN Biologics CROs The use of BPN Biologics CROs is optional, and the costs are covered by NIH. Applicants may propose the number and types of activities that will be conducted through BPN Biologics contractors. These activities may include:  Nonclinical studies, including bioanalytical and pharmacodynamic biomarker assay development and qualification, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and safety pharmacology and toxicology under non-GLP and GLP conditions Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) activities including small-scale synthesis, process development, analytical methods development, cell bank development, formulations development, scale-up, and cGMP manufacturing FIH clinical trial study planning, coordination, conduct, data handling, and reporting. As the clinical trial needs/requirements of biologics therapeutics vary, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIH Scientific/Research staff (listed in Section VII) to discuss the types of human subject trials currently supported by BPN Biologics clinical contractors. Any IP developed through these activities will be assigned to the applicant’s institution.  Consultants  All awarded projects receive support from NIH-contracted consultants at no cost to the PD/PI. Consultants are selected after award based on the project needs. Consultant areas of expertise include assay development, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, CMC, regulatory, and medical writing Applicants may also use grant funding for consultants selected and managed by the PD/PI who have been integral parts of the project team. A current list of BPN Biologics contractors and consultants is available at: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics/funding-opportunities#toc-application-support-library  G. Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO Non-responsive or incomplete applications will not be reviewed.  The following activities are considered non-responsive to this NOFO:  Basic research and studies of disease mechanism Animal model development and/or validation Mechanistic studies for how the proposed therapeutic acts at its target Stand-alone preclinical efficacy studies in animal models Development of in vitro screening assays for activity or selectivity Development of small molecule therapeutics (covered by PAR-24-043 and PAR-24-063) Development of diagnostics and medical devices Development of risk, diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and safety biomarkers Stand-alone clinical trials Studies directed beyond a first-in-human (FIH) phase 1 study (including open-label extensions, and IND-enabling nonclinical toxicology to support longer-term dosing beyond the FIH trial) Natural history clinical studies H. Milestones The awards funded under this NOFO are cooperative agreements. Clear, definitive milestones that quantitatively measure success and form the basis for go/no-go decision-making will be established in collaboration with NIH staff. Prior to funding, milestone plans will be developed by NIH staff with input from the PD/PI based on the project aims and feedback from the review process. In some cases, NIH-contracted consultants may be engaged during milestone development for additional guidance.  The final agreed upon and approved milestone plan will be incorporated into the Notice of Award. Milestones may be updated as needed with input from the LDT.  Note: If a funded project does not make satisfactory progress toward the agreed upon milestones at any stage during the funding period, access to BPN Biologics contract resources and future year grant funding will be discontinued (see Section VI.2).  U44 Phase I to Phase II Transition An administrative review will be conducted by NIH program staff, with technical input from an External Oversight Committee (composed of senior non-federal scientists who are not directly involved in BPN Biologics projects). Recommendations on whether projects will advance from the U44 Phase I to Phase II award will be made based on:  Successful achievement of U44 Phase I milestones The overall feasibility of project advancement, considering data that may not have been captured in milestones Competitive landscape for the disease indication and biotherapeutic target Program priorities Availability of funds Clinical Trial Initiation (if applicable) NIH requires the following for approval to commence a clinical trial (defined as signing of informed consent by the first prospective subject):  Successful achievement of the defined nonclinical and manufacturing milestones Submission of an IND application with documentation of one of the following: Acceptance of clinical protocol by FDA Elapse of the 30-day post filing waiting period without comment from the FDA Completion of protocol changes or amendments requested by FDA Submission of the clinical protocol and supporting documents to NIH for administrative review and notification of NIH approval. This may be done in collaboration with an NIH-provided CRO. Agreement on updated timeline and milestones for the clinical trial Submission of all NIH Human Subjects documentation if not using the NIH-provided CRO  I. Intellectual Property (IP) Since the ultimate goal of this program is to bring new biotherapeutics to the market, the program expects that recipient institutions will file and maintain any IP developed around the biotherapeutic during the project period. Institutions retain their rights to existing IP and are assigned rights to any new IP developed within the program.  The PD/PI(s) are expected to work closely with technology transfer/business development officials at their institution to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. Recipients are encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the biotherapeutic development process, consistent with the goals of the BPN Biologics.  J. Quality and Compliance Requirements Since the goal of this program is to generate therapeutics that will be eligible for FDA approval, adherence to compliance and quality criteria is required.  IND-enabling nonclinical studies must be performed in a manner consistent with GLP and current FDA guidance. Investigational products for use in clinical trials must be produced under cGMP practices. All clinical trials must be performed following Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in accord with NIH Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring and FDA guidelines.  K. Rigor and Transparency NIH strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, this NOFO explicitly emphasizes the NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency and provides additional guidance to the scientific community. For example, this NOFO supports applications in which the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on rigorous and robust supporting data, which means that data should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, this NOFO will support applicants that address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. This NOFO supports proposed experiments that are designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.  This NOFO intends to support applications with proposed clinical trials that must be based on robust and rigorous supporting data (e.g., from nonclinical in vivo and/or in vitro studies) and that demonstrate that there is an adequate scientific foundation to justify the proposed trial. This NOFO supports trial designs that also use rigorous and transparent approaches.  L. Pre-Application Consultation Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with the relevant Scientific/Research staff from the relevant NIH Institutes/Centers (see Section VII) when planning an application. Early contact provides an opportunity for staff to provide further guidance on program scope, goals, and how applicants may best utilize BPN Biologics resources. Ideally, applicants should contact program staff at least 12 weeks before a receipt date.  See Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.  Investigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the Research Methods Resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.",PAR-24-294,"Phase II",SBIR,HHS,,"August 19, 2027","October 1, 2024","December 27, 2024",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-24-294.html,Open,2024,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/11313
"NeuroNEXT Small Business Innovation in Clinical Trials (U44 Clinical Trial Optional)","Purpose:  To facilitate the cooperation and partnering of public and private funding organizations, universities, academic medical centers, research institutes, contract research organizations, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies, NINDS formed the Network for  Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT: https://neuronext.org. NeuroNEXT has a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and a group of geographically distributed clinical sites. This clinical research network develops and conducts multiple, scientifically sound, possibly biomarker-informed exploratory clinical trials evaluating the most promising therapies, whether from academic, foundation or industry discoveries. Examples include Phase 2 clinical trials and clinical research studies aimed at validating biomarkers and clinical outcomes in preparation for clinical trials. A separate clinical trials network has been established and funded by NINDS to conduct clinical trials and biomarker studies for stroke treatment, prevention and recovery; thus NeuroNEXT has been established for the conduct of studies in neurological disorders other than stroke.  NeuroNEXT provides a robust, standardized, and accessible infrastructure to facilitate rapid development and implementation of protocols in neurological disorders affecting adult and/or pediatric populations. While the network is not specific to one disease, it has the capacity to coordinate a cadre of specialist investigators to implement studies efficiently in response to disease-specific opportunities. The network is designed to increase the efficiency of clinical trials, to facilitate patient recruitment and retention, to increase the quality of neuroscience clinical trials, and to enable public-private partnerships. Applicants to this NOFO will be required to incorporate the NeuroNEXT infrastructure (www.neuronext.org) into their proposed study. Additional (ad-hoc) sites may be proposed to fulfill specific study requirements. All applicants will be required to use the master clinical trial agreements and central IRB that have been established for NeuroNEXT.  This NOFO uses the U44 cooperative agreement mechanism and is open to eligible applicants, as defined in Section III. Academic researchers may wish to consider applying through OTA-24-013 f(Stage 1 Preliminary) and OTA-24-014 Stage 2 Protocol) “NeuroNEXT Clinical Trials ”.  Since conducting the clinical trials needed for commercialization may be capital-intensive, this NOFO encourages business relationships between NIH's SBIR/STTR awardees and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. In particular, this NOFO will give competitive preferences and funding priority to applications deemed likely to result in a commercial product as indicated by an applicant's ability to secure independent third-party funds.  Definitions:  For this funding opportunity announcement, Phase I and II clinical studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. SBIR Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.  Scope of the Program:  This NOFO encourages Phase II SBIR applications for exploratory clinical trials of investigational agents (drugs, biologics, surgical therapies or devices) that may contribute to the justification for and provide the data required for designing a future trial, for biomarker validation studies, or for proof of mechanism clinical studies. Applications for drugs or biologics should be supported by compelling scientific evidence that the investigational agent proposed for study will reach/act upon the designated target or that its mechanism of action is such that it is expected to be of benefit in ameliorating a specific aspect of the disease. Neurologic diseases chosen for study must fall within the primary responsibility of NINDS (www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/index.htm). Multi-site studies in stroke prevention, treatment and/or recovery are not appropriate for this FOA; those studies would be considered by NIH StrokeNet: http://www.nihstrokenet.org/. A separate clinical trial network also exists for the conduct of studies in neurological emergencies (SIREN: https://siren.network/). Studies on these topics should be directed to the dedicated networks. Studies primarily focused on biomarker validation may also apply to one of the NINDS Biomarker funding opportunities https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-tools-topics/focus-biomarkers-research.  Applications proposing primarily phase 1 and 3 clinical trials should be directed to the exploratory clinical trial NOFO, PAR-22-142 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-142.html) and the efficacy clinical trial NOFO, PAR-21-237 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-237.html) respectively, or their reissues.   Examples of appropriate studies under this NOFO include, but are not limited to, those designed to:  Evaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in the target population. Validate biomarkers that are fit-for-purpose for a specific context of use and can be used in future clinical trials. Select or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, safety data, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy (e.g., futility trials). Evaluate biological activity relative to clinical endpoints. For medical devices, in addition to providing initial clinical safety data, appropriate studies are those that inform the next phase of development, usually by finalizing the device design, establishing operator technique, and/or finalizing the choice of study endpoints for the design of a pivotal clinical trial. This NOFO is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to confirm efficacy of a proposed intervention. While NeuroNEXT is primarily intended for exploratory trials, the network will consider Phase II/III trials in rare diseases with a US prevalence of under 200,000 persons as defined in the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-280 (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ280/content-detail.html)). Phase 1b/2a trials requiring multi-center implementation can be considered under this NOFO.  Working with NeuroNEXT is a cooperative venture between NINDS, the NeuroNEXT network and the applicant. NINDS will provide guidance to potential applicants with input from NINDS Program Staff and the NeuroNEXT Executive Committee. Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NINDS Scientific/Research Contacts (see Agency Contacts, Section VII) to discuss the feasibility of conducting the proposed trial through the NeuroNEXT infrastructure before submitting an application. Pre-application consultation may include an introductory teleconference (at least 3 months prior to submission), followed by a conference call or in-person meeting with NINDS staff, as needed.   Applicants should make note of the following:  (1) Medical devices: The NIH recognizes that devices can vary greatly in terms of basic form and function, physiological bases for therapy, degree of Invasiveness, etc. Consequently, the appropriate pathway to market may require a traditional Feasibility and Pivotal study in support of an eventual Pre-Market Approval submission, or  a more limited study to address specific issues in support of an FDA 510(k) or 510(k) De Novo submission. NINDS anticipates that the majority of device projects utilizing NeuroNEXT will be traditional Feasibility Studies in order to best leverage the advantages of the network. A Traditional Feasibility Study is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near-final or final device design to adequately plan a Pivotal Study.   (2) Biomarker validation studies: Biomarkers are defined as a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions. Categories of biomarkers include: Susceptibility/risk, diagnostic, monitoring, prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic/response, and safety. Biomarker studies should define their intended Context of Use (a statement that fully and clearly describes the way the biomarker will be used in future clinical trials).   (3) Rare diseases: Applications in rare diseases are encouraged while recognizing that available patient pools may not be adequate to meet the sample size requirements normally required to establish the efficacy of an intervention. NINDS acknowledges that innovative, non-traditional trial designs including adaptive designs may be appropriate in rare disease studies. Regardless of the design it is especially important to ensure that the study design and statistical analysis plans meet the stated objectives and allow for the most efficient evaluation of the limited subjects. The application should clearly demonstrate recruitment feasibility at the participating sites and applicants are encouraged to fully engage patient advocacy groups or similar representatives of the affected disease community in study design, execution, and reporting.   Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO  Nonclinical studies of disease mechanism or therapeutic mechanism of action studies  Animal studies  Single site studies  Research focused entirely on natural history studies Applications considered non-responsive will be withdrawn prior to review.  This NOFO requires a Community Engagement and Research Inclusion (CERI) Plan which will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation.  Assessment of applications containing a CERI Plan are based on descriptions of how community engagement strategies and community-engaged research will be employed during the planning period of the proposed study; specifically, five components, a) communities of interest, b) community partners (if applicable), c) partnership development, d) strategy for incorporation of input, and e) success evaluation metrics. Applications that fail to include a CERI Plan will be considered incomplete and will be administratively withdrawn before review.  The CERI Plan will be submitted as Other Project Information as an attachment (see Section IV).  Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully.",PAR-25-133,"Phase II",SBIR,HHS,NIH,"September 6, 2027","November 12, 2024","December 5, 2024",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-133.html,Open,2024,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/11356
"Small Business Transition Grant for New Entrepreneurs (R41/R42 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with its mission to improve health and save lives.    Successful small businesses require a breadth of expertise to bring a new technology to market. New companies striving to convert scientific discoveries into healthcare solutions require talented researchers who can also perform duties related to business and product development. While scientists, engineers, and health professionals offer valuable technical skillsets and practical insights required for technology development, academic training and professional experience often do not equip researchers with the skills and knowledge required to successfully navigate the entrepreneurial process, develop and commercialize products, or operate a small business. As a result, mission-driven scientists who are eager to apply their advanced skills through innovative research and development in an entrepreneurial setting may be insufficiently prepared for such roles and face high barriers to transitioning into an entrepreneurial career.    Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. NIH has a commitment to supporting a sustainable and diverse biomedical research workforce (see, e.g., Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031). Fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses in technological innovation is one of the goals of the SBIR and STTR programs (https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf).    Investigators interested in transitioning into an entrepreneurial career path benefit from tailored entrepreneurial training, mentoring, and career development, as well as opportunities to lead innovative research and development programs with strong potential for commercialization. Supplementing the traditional academic experience with training in entrepreneurship and innovation can help provide scientists with both the scientific acumen and business skillset that play a key role in translating innovative ideas into commercial products. By facilitating such training experience, start-ups and other small businesses can recruit and integrate needed domain expertise while at the same time augmenting the entrepreneurial workforce and empowering scientists.    Purpose  The awarding components identified in this NOFO intend to support early-career scientists and health professionals interested in transitioning to a small business to gain industry experience, receive entrepreneurial training and mentorship, and advance biomedical technology with commercial potential as a PD/PI. This NOFO is not intended to support projects led by PDs/PIs with substantial entrepreneurial, business, scientific, or other professional experience. PDs/PIs with significant experience are encouraged to work with their organizations to submit applications to other SBIR and STTR Notices of Funding Opportunity.    This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) utilizes the R41/R42 STTR Award mechanism to provide small business concerns (SBCs) support for research and development efforts, as well as the opportunity to increase their scientific staff by supporting the employment and salaries of researchers as Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) overseeing the supported research project. It is expected that each SBC will ensure robust entrepreneurial training and mentorship for the PD/PI, while the PD/PI will bring valuable technical knowledge and/or practical medical expertise to the SBC. This award provides an opportunity for researchers to accelerate growth of their entrepreneurial skills by serving as PDs/PIs while pursuing entrepreneurial training activities. Training activities may include NIH entrepreneurial training programs, locally and/or widely available entrepreneurship- or business-focused courses or workshops, or other options that best serve the PD/PI and SBC needs. Additionally, the SBC is expected to assemble a strong mentoring team that supports the career growth and development of the PD/PI.    SBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. An NIH STTR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Further information about the SBIR and STTR programs can be found at https://seed.nih.gov. Frequently asked questions are available to assist applicants and can answer many basic questions about the program.    This NOFO invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit STTR Phase I and Fast-Track grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an SBIR grant application should submit to PAR-24-131. Applications submitted to this NOFO are not allowed to propose clinical trial(s). STTR applications that propose clinical trial(s) should be submitted to PAR-24-134. Direct to Phase II applications are not allowed under this funding opportunity and should be submitted to another STTR Notice of Funding Opportunity.    Key Components  A. Mentorship    One primary criterion of this NOFO is mentorship. Applications must identify at least one mentor who will facilitate the successful completion of the project, from both the technical and commercial points of view. In doing so, the mentor will also equip the PD/PI with key technical and business acumen. The mentor should have extensive entrepreneurial and prior mentorship experience. The mentor can be a co-founder, owner, or C-level executive in the SBC, though neither holding one of these positions nor being affiliated with the applicant SBC is required. Mentors may not serve as a multiple PD/PI (MPI). Other mentors or mentoring teams that can provide additional focal points of guidance may be included by the applicant.    B. Entrepreneurship Training    Another key component of the program is entrepreneurship training. A career development plan for the PD/PI is required, and may include a combination of coursework, workshops, or other programs. Mentors should play a key role in identifying appropriate training opportunities to bolster the technical and business acumen of the PD/PI, as well as the commercial prospects of the proposed research and capacity of the small business.    C. Eligibility    This NOFO supports the transition of early-career researchers into entrepreneurial roles, and eligibility of the contact PD/PI is limited to scientists, engineers, and health professionals, including certain late-stage students, postdoctoral fellows or associates, and clinicians, who are new to research entrepreneurship and have not independently led significant research programs. (See Section III for eligibility information.) The transitioning researcher should possess research skills and experience in scientific discovery or technology development. All eligible scientists are encouraged to apply; optimal PDs/PIs for this award may be Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators. NIH always encourages individuals from diverse backgrounds, including individuals from underrepresented groups in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences, such as individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from other disadvantaged backgrounds, and women to work with their organizations to apply for NIH support. (See Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031; see also Reminder: Notice of NIH's Encouragement of Applications Supporting Individuals from Underrepresented Ethnic and Racial Groups as well as Individuals with Disabilities, NOT-OD-22-019.) With an interest in expanding the range of institutions training researchers entering the biomedical entrepreneurial workforce, NIH also strongly encourages applications with eligible PDs/PIs who are graduates or affiliates of institutions in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states or Resource-Limited Institutions. (See Notice of Special Interest: Encouraging Small Businesses to Partner with Resource-Limited Institutions (RLIs) on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Applications, NOT-OD-23-179.)    The PD/PI may be a new employee hired for the purpose of leading the program described in the application or may be an existing employee newly elevated to a position of genuine leadership, responsibility, and authority for the purpose of directing the activities proposed in the application. Additional investigators can serve as MPI and provide support to the transition of the scientist to a PD/PI role within the small business. However, applicants utilizing a multi-PD/PI option should ensure the transitioning scientist is listed as the contact PD/PI on the application and has a clearly defined role that allows sufficient autonomy to exercise genuine leadership and independence that enables personal and professional growth.    D. Scientific/Technical Scope    To be responsive to this PAR, proposed projects must pertain to the mission space of one of the participating Institutes and Centers (ICs) and the proposed technology must fall within the scope of the traditional SBIR/STTR grant mechanisms. Applicants are encouraged to contact the Scientific/Research Contacts from pertinent NIH ICs listed in Section VII prior to submission to discuss IC program relevance. Furthermore, all proposals must include clear, quantitative milestones (i.e., a quantitative definition of success) for each aim for both research and development and entrepreneurial development. In some cases, additional milestones or timelines may be requested as part of the Just-in-Time process or post-award.    Institute/Center Priorities  National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)    NCATS is transforming translational science to improve human health; it relies on the power of data, new technologies and teamwork to develop, demonstrate and disseminate innovations that reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in translational research. NCATS small business funding is designed specifically to transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for diseases can be delivered to patients more quickly.

"Small Business Transition Grant for New Entrepreneurs (R41/R42 Clinical Trial Required)","Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description Background The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with its mission to improve health and save lives.  Successful small businesses require a breadth of expertise to bring a new technology to market. New companies striving to convert scientific discoveries into healthcare solutions require talented researchers who can also perform duties related to business and product development. While scientists, engineers, and health professionals offer valuable technical skillsets and practical insights required for technology development, academic training and professional experience often do not equip researchers with the skills and knowledge required to successfully navigate the entrepreneurial process, develop and commercialize products, or operate a small business. As a result, mission-driven scientists who are eager to apply their advanced skills through innovative research and development in an entrepreneurial setting may be insufficiently prepared for such roles and face high barriers to transitioning into an entrepreneurial career.  Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. NIH has a commitment to supporting a sustainable and diverse biomedical research workforce (see, e.g., Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031). Fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses in technological innovation is one of the goals of the SBIR and STTR programs (https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf).  Investigators interested in transitioning into an entrepreneurial career path benefit from tailored entrepreneurial training, mentoring, and career development, as well as opportunities to lead innovative research and development programs with strong potential for commercialization. Supplementing the traditional academic experience with training in entrepreneurship and innovation can help provide scientists with both the scientific acumen and business skillset that play a key role in translating innovative ideas into commercial products. By facilitating such training experience, start-ups and other small businesses can recruit and integrate needed domain expertise while at the same time augmenting the entrepreneurial workforce and empowering scientists.  Purpose The awarding components identified in this NOFO intend to support early-career scientists and health professionals interested in transitioning to a small business to gain industry experience, receive entrepreneurial training and mentorship, and advance biomedical technology with commercial potential as a PD/PI. This NOFO is not intended to support projects led by PDs/PIs with substantial entrepreneurial, business, scientific, or other professional experience. PDs/PIs with significant experience are encouraged to work with their organizations to submit applications to other SBIR and STTR Notices of Funding Opportunity.  This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) utilizes the R41/R42 STTR Award mechanism to provide small business concerns (SBCs) support for research and development efforts, as well as the opportunity to increase their scientific staff by supporting the employment and salaries of researchers as Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) overseeing the supported research project. It is expected that each SBC will ensure robust entrepreneurial training and mentorship for the PD/PI, while the PD/PI will bring valuable technical knowledge and/or practical medical expertise to the SBC. This award provides an opportunity for researchers to accelerate growth of their entrepreneurial skills by serving as PDs/PIs while pursuing entrepreneurial training activities. Training activities may include NIH entrepreneurial training programs, locally and/or widely available entrepreneurship- or business-focused courses or workshops, or other options that best serve the PD/PI and SBC needs. Additionally, the SBC is expected to assemble a strong mentoring team that supports the career growth and development of the PD/PI.  SBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. An NIH STTR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Further information about the SBIR and STTR programs can be found at https://seed.nih.gov. Frequently asked questions are available to assist applicants and can answer many basic questions about the program.  This NOFO invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit STTR Phase I and Fast-Track grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an SBIR grant application should submit to PAR-24-132. All applications submitted to this NOFO must propose clinical trial(s). STTR applications that do not propose clinical trial(s) should be submitted to PAR-24-133. Direct to Phase II applications are not allowed under this funding opportunity and should be submitted to another STTR Notice of Funding Opportunity.  Key Components A. Mentorship  One primary criterion of this NOFO is mentorship. Applications must identify at least one mentor who will facilitate the successful completion of the project, from both the technical and commercial points of view. In doing so, the mentor will also equip the PD/PI with key technical and business acumen. The mentor should have extensive entrepreneurial and prior mentorship experience. The mentor can be a co-founder, owner, or C-level executive in the SBC, though neither holding one of these positions nor being affiliated with the applicant SBC is required. Mentors may not serve as a multiple PD/PI (MPI). Other mentors or mentoring teams that can provide additional focal points of guidance may be included by the applicant.  B. Entrepreneurship Training  Another key component of the program is entrepreneurship training. A career development plan for the PD/PI is required, and may include a combination of coursework, workshops, or other programs. Mentors should play a key role in identifying appropriate training opportunities to bolster the technical and business acumen of the PD/PI, as well as the commercial prospects of the proposed research and capacity of the small business.  C. Eligibility  This NOFO supports the transition of early-career researchers into entrepreneurial roles, and eligibility of the contact PD/PI is limited to scientists, engineers, and health professionals, including certain late-stage students, postdoctoral fellows or associates, and clinicians, who are new to research entrepreneurship and have not independently led significant research programs. (See Section III for eligibility information.) The transitioning researcher should possess research skills and experience in scientific discovery or technology development. All eligible scientists are encouraged to apply; optimal PDs/PIs for this award may be Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators. NIH always encourages individuals from diverse backgrounds, including individuals from underrepresented groups in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences, such as individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from other disadvantaged backgrounds, and women to work with their organizations to apply for NIH support. (See Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031; see also Reminder: Notice of NIH's Encouragement of Applications Supporting Individuals from Underrepresented Ethnic and Racial Groups as well as Individuals with Disabilities, NOT-OD-22-019.) With an interest in expanding the range of institutions training researchers entering the biomedical entrepreneurial workforce, NIH also strongly encourages applications with eligible PDs/PIs who are graduates or affiliates of institutions in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states or Resource-Limited Institutions. (See Notice of Special Interest: Encouraging Small Businesses to Partner with Resource-Limited Institutions (RLIs) on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Applications, NOT-OD-23-179.)  The PD/PI may be a new employee hired for the purpose of leading the program described in the application or may be an existing employee newly elevated to a position of genuine leadership, responsibility, and authority for the purpose of directing the activities proposed in the application. Additional investigators can serve as MPI and provide support to the transition of the scientist to a PD/PI role within the small business. However, applicants utilizing a multi-PD/PI option should ensure the transitioning scientist is listed as the contact PD/PI on the application and has a clearly defined role that allows sufficient autonomy to exercise genuine leadership and independence that enables personal and professional growth.  D. Scientific/Technical Scope  To be responsive to this PAR, proposed projects must pertain to the mission space of one of the participating Institutes and Centers (ICs) and the proposed technology must fall within the scope of the traditional SBIR/STTR grant mechanisms. Applicants are encouraged to contact the Scientific/Research Contacts from pertinent NIH ICs listed in Section VII prior to submission to discuss IC program relevance. Furthermore, all proposals must include clear, quantitative milestones (i.e., a quantitative definition of success) for each aim for both research and development and entrepreneurial development. In some cases, additional milestones or timelines may be requested as part of the Just-in-Time process or post-award.  Institute/Center Priorities National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)  The NCCIH supports the development and validation of technologies that can facilitate the integration of complementary and integrative health approaches to enhance diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases and/or associated symptoms, or promotion of well-being and whole person health. In addition, the NCCIH supports the integration of the technologies with multisystem studies to understand the connections and interactions across the systems and/or the impact of multi-component interventions on multisystem connections and interactions in pre-clinical models and/or human subjects. NCCIH will not fund clinical efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention at Phase I.  Complementary health approaches include a broad range of practices and interventions that are not typically part of conventional medical care and can be classified by their primary therapeutic input, including nutritional (e.g., special diets, dietary supplements, herbs, probiotics, and microbial-based therapies), psychological (e.g., meditation, hypnosis, music-based interventions, relaxation therapies), physical (e.g., acupuncture, massage, chiropractic manipulation, other force-based manipulations, or devices related to these approaches), or a combination of psychological and physical (e.g., yoga, tai chi, dance therapies, or some forms of art therapies, such as music-based interventions) input.

While scientists, engineers, and health professionals offer valuable technical skillsets and practical insights required for technology development, academic training and professional experience often do not equip researchers with the skills and knowledge required to successfully navigate the entrepreneurial process, develop and commercialize products, or operate a small business. As a result, mission-driven scientists who are eager to apply their advanced skills through innovative research and development in an entrepreneurial setting may be insufficiently prepared for such roles and face high barriers to transitioning into an entrepreneurial career.    Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. NIH has a commitment to supporting a sustainable and diverse biomedical research workforce (see, e.g., Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031). CDC similarly encourages applications from organizations that support scientists and trainees with diverse backgrounds, including sexual orientation and gender identify minorities as well as individuals with disabilities. Fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses in technological innovation is one of the goals of the SBIR and STTR programs (https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf).    Investigators interested in transitioning into an entrepreneurial career path benefit from tailored entrepreneurial training, mentoring, and career development, as well as opportunities to lead innovative research and development programs with strong potential for commercialization. Supplementing the traditional academic experience with training in entrepreneurship and innovation can help provide scientists with both the scientific acumen and business skillset that play a key role in translating innovative ideas into commercial products. By facilitating such training experience, start-ups and other small businesses can recruit and integrate needed domain expertise while at the same time augmenting the entrepreneurial workforce and empowering scientists.    Purpose  The awarding components identified in this NOFO intend to support early-career scientists and health professionals interested in transitioning to a small business to gain industry experience, receive entrepreneurial training and mentorship, and advance biomedical or public health technology with commercial potential as a PD/PI. This NOFO is not intended to support projects led by PDs/PIs with substantial entrepreneurial, business, scientific, or other professional experience. PDs/PIs with significant experience are encouraged to work with their organizations to submit applications to other SBIR and STTR Notices of Funding Opportunity.    This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) utilizes the R43/R44 SBIR Award mechanism to provide small business concerns (SBCs) support for research and development efforts, as well as the opportunity to increase their scientific staff by supporting the employment and salaries of researchers as Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) overseeing the supported research project. It is expected that each SBC will ensure robust entrepreneurial training and mentorship for the PD/PI, while the PD/PI will bring valuable technical knowledge and/or practical medical or public health expertise to the SBC. This award provides an opportunity for researchers to accelerate growth of their entrepreneurial skills by serving as PDs/PIs while pursuing entrepreneurial training activities. Training activities may include NIH entrepreneurial training programs, locally and/or widely available entrepreneurship- or business-focused courses or workshops, or other options that best serve the PD/PI and SBC needs. Additionally, the SBC is expected to assemble a strong mentoring team that supports the career growth and development of the PD/PI.    SBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Further information about the SBIR and STTR programs can be found at https://seed.nih.gov and https://www.cdc.gov/os/technology/innovation/sbir.htm. Frequently asked questions are available to assist applicants and can answer many basic questions about the program.    This NOFO invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit SBIR Phase I and Fast-Track grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PAR-24-134. All applications submitted to this NOFO must propose clinical trial(s). SBIR applications that do not propose clinical trial(s) should be submitted to PAR-24-131. Direct to Phase II applications are not allowed under this funding opportunity and should be submitted to another SBIR Notice of Funding Opportunity.    Key Components  A. Mentorship    One primary criterion of this NOFO is mentorship. Applications must identify at least one mentor who will facilitate the successful completion of the project, from both the technical and commercial points of view. In doing so, the mentor will also equip the PD/PI with key technical and business acumen. The mentor should have extensive entrepreneurial and prior mentorship experience. The mentor can be a co-founder, owner, or C-level executive in the SBC, though neither holding one of these positions nor being affiliated with the applicant SBC is required. Mentors may not serve as a multiple PD/PI (MPI). Other mentors or mentoring teams that can provide additional focal points of guidance may be included by the applicant.    B. Entrepreneurship Training    Another key component of the program is entrepreneurship training. A career development plan for the PD/PI is required, and may include a combination of coursework, workshops, or other programs. Mentors should play a key role in identifying appropriate training opportunities to bolster the technical and business acumen of the PD/PI, as well as the commercial prospects of the proposed research and capacity of the small business.    C. Eligibility    This NOFO supports the transition of early-career researchers into entrepreneurial roles, and eligibility of the contact PD/PI is limited to scientists, engineers, and health professionals, including certain late-stage students, postdoctoral fellows or associates, clinicians, and public health practitioners, who are new to research entrepreneurship and have not independently led significant research programs. (See Section III for eligibility information.) The transitioning researcher should possess research skills and experience in scientific discovery or technology development. All eligible scientists are encouraged to apply; optimal PDs/PIs for this award may be Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators. NIH always encourages individuals from diverse backgrounds, including individuals from underrepresented groups in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences, such as individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from other disadvantaged backgrounds, and women to work with their organizations to apply for NIH support. (See Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031; see also Reminder: Notice of NIH's Encouragement of Applications Supporting Individuals from Underrepresented Ethnic and Racial Groups as well as Individuals with Disabilities, NOT-OD-22-019.) CDC similarly encourages applications from organizations that are uniquely prepared to address underserved groups, including sexual orientation and gender identity minorities as well as individuals with disabilities. With an interest in expanding the range of institutions training researchers entering the biomedical entrepreneurial workforce, NIH and CDC also strongly encourage applications with eligible PDs/PIs who are graduates or affiliates of institutions in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states or Resource-Limited Institutions. (See Notice of Special Interest: Encouraging Small Businesses to Partner with Resource-Limited Institutions (RLIs) on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Applications, NOT-OD-23-179.)    The PD/PI may be a new employee hired for the purpose of leading the program described in the application or may be an existing employee newly elevated to a position of genuine leadership, responsibility, and authority for the purpose of directing the activities proposed in the application. Additional investigators can serve as MPI and provide support to the transition of the scientist to a PD/PI role within the small business. However, applicants utilizing a multi-PD/PI option should ensure the transitioning scientist is listed as the contact PD/PI on the application and has a clearly defined role that allows sufficient autonomy to exercise genuine leadership and independence that enables personal and professional growth.    D. Scientific/Technical Scope    To be responsive to this PAR, proposed projects must pertain to the mission space of one of the participating Institutes and Centers (ICs) and the proposed technology must fall within the scope of the traditional SBIR/STTR grant mechanisms. Applicants are encouraged to contact the Scientific/Research Contacts from pertinent NIH and CDC ICs listed in Section VII prior to submission to discuss IC program relevance. Furthermore, all proposals must include clear, quantitative milestones (i.e., a quantitative definition of success) for each aim for both research and development and entrepreneurial development. In some cases, additional milestones or timelines may be requested as part of the Just-in-Time process or post-award.    Institute/Center Priorities  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)    The NCCIH supports the development and validation of technologies that can facilitate the integration of complementary and integrative health approaches to enhance diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases and/or associated symptoms, or promotion of well-being and whole person health.

"PHS 2024-2 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH for Small Business Technology Transfer Grant Applications (Parent STTR [R41/R42] Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","Background  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with their mission to improve health and save lives.  As described by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the statutory purpose of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is to strengthen the role of innovative small business concerns (SBCs) in federally-funded research or research and development. The purpose of the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program is to stimulate a partnership of ideas and technologies between innovative SBCs and non-profit Research Institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their extramural research budget to the SBIR program, and those with extramural research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside an additional 0.45% to the STTR program.  Purpose  This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I, Phase II, Fast-Track, and Phase IIB grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an SBIR grant application should submit toPA-24-245 and PA-24-246  SBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a ""Renewal"" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.  NIH Fast-Track: An NIH STTR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  NIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR or STTR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be a strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed Phase IIB project. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants must provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors. NIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR NOFO or other specific NOFOs, are listed in the  SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. Additional requirements and instructions (e.g., submission of a letter of intent) are available in the specific IC research topics section and in the NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities that allow Phase IIB applications.  Specific Objectives  The  SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA represent scientific program areas that may be of interest to applicant small businesses in the development of projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise to contribute to the R&D mission(s) of the NIH awarding components identified in this NOFO are encouraged to submit STTR grant applications in these areas. STTR grant applications will also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the Components of Participating Organizations listed for this NOFO. In addition to the general STTR solicitations, some awarding components have additional, specific NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities of potential interest to small businesses.  Applicants are not required to identify a potential awarding component prior to submission of the application but may request one on the Assignment Request Form. Staff within the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point for all NIH grant applications, will assign all applications to the most appropriate Agency and Institute/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science proposed. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices website.  All applications submitted to this Parent Notice of Funding Opportunity are not allowed to propose clinical trial(s). STTR applications that propose clinical trial(s) should be submitted to PA-24-248.  Further information about the SBIR and STTR programs can be found at https://seed.nih.gov. Frequently asked questions are available to assist applicants and can answer many basic questions about the program.",PA-24-247,BOTH,STTR,HHS,NIH,"September 6, 2025","July 3, 2024","August 5, 2024",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-24-247.html,Open,2024,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/11127
"NINDS Renewal Awards of SBIR Phase II Grants (Phase IIB) for Pre-Clinical Research (R44 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","Purpose  NINDS is committed to advancing treatments, tools, and diagnostics that benefit people burdened by neurological diseases through the NINDS Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.  The development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the Valley of Death). To achieve commercialization, some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable grant-in-aid financing beyond the SBIR/STTR Phase II award to achieve follow-on investment or commercialization. In particular, the development of regulated products such as therapeutics and medical devices often requires several years and substantial capital investments, due in part to the high costs of clinical trials.  In addition, NINDS recognizes that companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or that target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive to investors and strategic partners at preclinical or early clinical stages of development. Many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically disparate patient populations.  For the purposes of this NOFO, NINDS has defined small markets as development of novel products that:  Address a rare disease as defined in the Orphan Drug Act Amendment of 1984 as any disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States Qualify as a Humanitarian Use Device, defined as a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 persons in the United States per year Target a young pediatric population defined as including neonates (0-28 days), infants (<2 years), and/or children (2-12 years of age), as indicated in the FDA Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices. Are tools intended for the neuroscience research market The goal of this NOFO is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product/technology that requires Federal regulatory approval or to bring a complex research tool to market. To achieve this goal, the NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II projects to the commercialization stage by encouraging business relationships between NIH’s SBIR/STTR recipients  and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. In particular, this NOFO will give competitive preference and funding priority to applications deemed likely to result in a commercial product as indicated by an applicant's ability to secure partnerships within a broad range of potential third-parties.  Specific Objectives  Independent Third-Party Partners  This NOFO is specifically intended to encourage business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide substantial financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products and technologies initiated with NIH SBIR or STTR funding. In particular, applicants are expected to leverage their previous NIH SBIR or STTR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NINDS funding under this NOFO, to negotiate and attract third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant’s ability to secure funds will provide a measure of commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR applications submitted to this NOFO. This commercial potential will be strongly considered in making funding decisions. It is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party partners will involve a considerable level of project due diligence, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. Third-party partners include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an “angel” investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a state or local government, or any combination of the above. In light of these goals, the NINDS strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in the commercialization of emerging biomedical technologies.  NINDS expects companies working in small markets (as defined above) to secure independent third-party funding equal to or greater than one-third of the NINDS funds being requested throughout the project period. For all other projects, it is expected that the level of this independent third-party funding will be equal to or greater than the NINDS funds being requested throughout the Phase IIB Bridge Award project period.  Scientific/Technical Scope  This NOFO is specifically designed to provide additional support for products/technologies that require ultimate approval by a Federal regulatory agency or complex research tools. Such products include, but are not limited to:  Therapeutics or diagnostics that require FDA approval, including medical implants, drugs, biologics, biomarkers, and new treatment or diagnostic tools. Complex research tools. Clinical research tools: Such tools would include those that are developed for clinical research use that do not require any federal regulatory approval, but still require extensive development in order to demonstrate validity. The technical and commercial objectives described in the SBIR Phase IIB application must represent an extension of the development efforts that were pursued in a previously funded NIH SBIR/STTR Phase II grant or contract.   NINDS, as part of NIH, strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, NINDS explicitly emphasizes the NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm) and provides additional guidance to the scientific community (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/grant_policy). For example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on a robust and rigorous scientific rationale, which means that data supporting the scientific rationale should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.  Renewal applications of SBIR Phase II awards (i.e. SBIR Phase IIB) to conduct clinical trials are not included in this NOFO and should be submitted to NINDS Renewal Awards of SBIR Phase II Grants (Phase IIB) for Clinical Trials and Clinical Research (R44 Clinical Trial Optional). A clinical trial, as defined by the NIH, is a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes. Please read Notice NOT-OD-15-015 for more details.  Fostering and encouraging applications from socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses in technological innovation is one of the goals of the SBIR and STTR programs (https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf). To broaden the range of institutions training researchers entering the biomedical entrepreneurial workforce, NIH also strongly encourages applications with eligible PDs/PIs who are graduates or affiliates of institutions in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states or Resource-Limited Institutions. (See Notice of Special Interest: Encouraging Small Businesses to Partner with Resource-Limited Institutions (RLIs) on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Applications, NOT-OD-23-179.)  Applicants should take note of the following:  Applicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing NINDS research resources for their studies whenever possible. Such resources may include biospecimens from NINDS Human Biospecimen and Data Repository (BioSEND) or informatics system. The NINDS BioSEND repository receives, processes, stores, and distributes biospecimen resources from NINDS funded studies that can be shared by the neuroscience research community, and currently banks a variety of biospecimens including DNA, plasma, serum, RNA, CSF, and saliva. The NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository provides 1) disease-relevant stem cell lines for biomarker discovery, and/or 2) the capacity to bank blood for the creation of new cell lines relevant to their disease of interest. Leveraging the resources and support from neurological disorder advocacy groups, private research foundations, academic institutions, other government agencies and the NIH Intramural program are also encouraged. Finally, applicants are encouraged to leverage the resources of ongoing clinical trials supported through other Federal or private funds.  Applications proposing to collect biospecimens are strongly recommended to use the BioSEND protocols and procedures, and all specimens collected and banked with BioSEND must come from individuals who have consented to banking and sharing broadly with academia and industry. Note that costs for collection are NOT included as a component of the NINDS Biomarkers Repository award. Therefore, most costs for the biospecimen banking are borne by the recipients  utilizing this resource (see NOT-NS-15-046). Applicants planning projects in which biospecimens will be collected are strongly advised to consult the BioSEND website for more information about samples banked at the repository. In addition, applicants are advised to consult with BioSEND staff to obtain a quote for biospecimen banking costs (email: biosend@iu.edu).",PAR-24-222,"Phase II",SBIR,HHS,NIH,"April 6, 2027","June 21, 2024","August 5, 2024",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-24-222.html,Open,2024,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/11546
"Small Business Transition Grant for New Entrepreneurs (R43/R44 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with their mission to improve health and save lives.    Successful small businesses require a breadth of expertise to bring a new technology to market. New companies striving to convert scientific discoveries into healthcare solutions require talented researchers who can also perform duties related to business and product development. While scientists, engineers, and health professionals offer valuable technical skillsets and practical insights required for technology development, academic training and professional experience often do not equip researchers with the skills and knowledge required to successfully navigate the entrepreneurial process, develop and commercialize products, or operate a small business. As a result, mission-driven scientists who are eager to apply their advanced skills through innovative research and development in an entrepreneurial setting may be insufficiently prepared for such roles and face high barriers to transitioning into an entrepreneurial career.    Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.  NIH has a commitment to supporting a sustainable and diverse biomedical research workforce (see, e.g., Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031). CDC similarly encourages applications from organizations that support scientists and trainees with diverse backgrounds, including sexual orientation and gender identify minorities as well as individuals with disabilities.  Fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses in technological innovation is one of the goals of the SBIR and STTR programs (https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf).    Investigators interested in transitioning into an entrepreneurial career path benefit from tailored entrepreneurial training, mentoring, and career development, as well as opportunities to lead innovative research and development programs with strong potential for commercialization. Supplementing the traditional academic experience with training in entrepreneurship and innovation can help provide scientists with both the scientific acumen and business skillset that play a key role in translating innovative ideas into commercial products. By facilitating such training experience, start-ups and other small businesses can recruit and integrate needed domain expertise while at the same time augmenting the entrepreneurial workforce and empowering scientists.    Purpose  The awarding components identified in this NOFO intend to support early-career scientists and health professionals interested in transitioning to a small business to gain industry experience, receive entrepreneurial training and mentorship, and advance biomedical or public health technology with commercial potential as a PD/PI. This NOFO is not intended to support projects led by PDs/PIs with substantial entrepreneurial, business, scientific, or other professional experience. PDs/PIs with significant experience are encouraged to work with their organization to submit applications to other SBIR and STTR Notices of Funding Opportunity.    This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) utilizes the R43/R44 SBIR Award mechanism to provide small business concerns (SBCs) support for research and development efforts, as well as the opportunity to increase their scientific staff by supporting the employment and salaries of researchers as Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) overseeing the supported research project. It is expected that each SBC will ensure robust entrepreneurial training and mentorship for the PD/PI, while the PD/PI will bring valuable technical knowledge and/or practical medical or public health expertise to the SBC. This award provides an opportunity for researchers to accelerate growth of their entrepreneurial skills by serving as PDs/PIs while pursuing entrepreneurial training activities. Training activities may include NIH entrepreneurial training programs, locally and/or widely available entrepreneurship- or business-focused courses or workshops, or other options that best serve the PD/PI and SBC needs. Additionally, the SBC is expected to assemble a strong mentoring team that supports the career growth and development of the PD/PI.    SBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Further information about the SBIR and STTR programs can be found at https://seed.nih.gov and https://www.cdc.gov/os/technology/innovation/sbir.htm. Frequently asked questions are available to assist applicants and can answer many basic questions about the program.    This NOFO invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit SBIR Phase I and Fast-Track grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PAR-24-133. Applications submitted to this NOFO are not allowed to propose clinical trial(s). SBIR applications that propose clinical trial(s) should be submitted to PAR-24-132. Direct to Phase II applications are not allowed under this funding opportunity and should be submitted to another SBIR Notice of Funding Opportunity.    Key Components  A. Mentorship    One primary criterion of this NOFO is mentorship. Applications must identify at least one mentor who will facilitate the successful completion of the project, from both the technical and commercial points of view. In doing so, the mentor will also equip the PD/PI with key technical and business acumen. The mentor should have extensive entrepreneurial and prior mentorship experience. The mentor can be a co-founder, owner, or C-level executive in the SBC, though neither holding one of these positions nor being affiliated with the applicant SBC is required. Mentors may not serve as a multiple PD/PI (MPI). Other mentors or mentoring teams that can provide additional focal points of guidance may be included by the applicant.    B. Entrepreneurship Training    Another key component of the program is entrepreneurship training. A career development plan for the PD/PI is required, and may include a combination of coursework, workshops, or other programs. Mentors should play a key role in identifying appropriate training opportunities to bolster the technical and business acumen of the PD/PI, as well as the commercial prospects of the proposed research and capacity of the small business.    C. Eligibility    This NOFO supports the transition of early-career researchers into entrepreneurial roles, and eligibility of the contact PD/PI is limited to scientists, engineers, and health professionals, including certain late-stage students, postdoctoral fellows or associates, clinicians, and public health practitioners, who are new to research entrepreneurship and have not independently led significant research programs. (See Section III for eligibility information.) The transitioning researcher should possess research skills and experience in scientific discovery or technology development. All eligible scientists are encouraged to apply; optimal PDs/PIs for this award may be Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators. NIH always encourages individuals from diverse backgrounds, including individuals from underrepresented groups in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences, such as individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from other disadvantaged backgrounds, and women to work with their organizations to apply for NIH support. (See Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031; see also Reminder: Notice of NIH's Encouragement of Applications Supporting Individuals from Underrepresented Ethnic and Racial Groups as well as Individuals with Disabilities, NOT-OD-22-019.) CDC similarly encourages applications from organizations that are uniquely prepared to address underserved groups, including sexual orientation and gender identity minorities as well as individuals with disabilities. With an interest in expanding the range of institutions training researchers entering the biomedical entrepreneurial workforce, NIH and CDC also strongly encourage applications with eligible PDs/PIs who are graduates or affiliates of institutions in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states or Resource-Limited Institutions. (See Notice of Special Interest: Encouraging Small Businesses to Partner with Resource-Limited Institutions (RLIs) on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Applications, NOT-OD-23-179.)    The PD/PI may be a new employee hired for the purpose of leading the program described in the application or may be an existing employee newly elevated to a position of genuine leadership, responsibility, and authority for the purpose of directing the activities proposed in the application. Additional investigators can serve as MPI and provide support to the transition of the scientist to a PD/PI role within the small business. However, applicants utilizing a multi-PD/PI option should ensure the transitioning scientist is listed as the contact PD/PI on the application and has a clearly defined role that allows sufficient autonomy to exercise genuine leadership and independence that enables personal and professional growth.    D. Scientific/Technical Scope    To be responsive to this PAR, proposed projects must pertain to the mission space of one of the participating Institutes and Centers (ICs) and the proposed technology must fall within the scope of the traditional SBIR/STTR grant mechanisms. Applicants are encouraged to contact the Scientific/Research Contacts from pertinent NIH and CDC ICs listed in Section VII prior to submission to discuss IC program relevance. Furthermore, all proposals must include clear, quantitative milestones (i.e., a quantitative definition of success) for each aim for both research and development and entrepreneurial development. In some cases, additional milestones or timelines may be requested as part of the Just-in-Time process or post-award.

"NINDS Renewal Awards of SBIR Phase II Grants (Phase IIB) for Clinical Trials and Clinical Research (R44 Clinical Trial Optional)","Purpose    NINDS is committed to advancing treatments, tools, and diagnostics that benefit people burdened by neurological diseases through the NINDS Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.    The development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the Valley of Death). To achieve commercialization, some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable grant-in-aid financing beyond the SBIR/STTR Phase II award to achieve follow-on investment or commercialization. In particular, the development of regulated products such as therapeutics and medical devices often requires several years and substantial capital investments, due in part to the high costs of clinical trials.    This NOFO supports applications from Small Business Concerns (SBCs) for exploratory clinical trials or studies that contribute to the justification for a future trial to establish definitive efficacy (such as a Phase 3 clinical trial or a Pivotal device trial). This includes Phase 1 and 2 studies of drugs and biologics, feasibility and preliminary efficacy studies of devices, first-in-human studies (as defined by the Food and Drug Administration), as well as early studies of surgical, behavioral or rehabilitation therapies. This NOFO supports single-site and multi-site trials with up to three clinical sites. Applications must aim to generate data that inform further clinical development of the proposed intervention or diagnostic, and in the case of FDA-regulated clinical trials applications must demonstrate readiness by including FDA approval of the proposed study. The earliest clinical studies should be designed to provide important initial information regarding the intervention (e.g., safety, tolerability, dosing) or diagnostic. Mid-stage clinical studies will generally include randomization and blinding and should yield data that allow a clear go/no-go decision regarding whether the intervention should proceed to an efficacy trial. All applications must outline specific plans for future development in the event of promising results.    In addition, NINDS recognizes that companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or that target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive to investors and strategic partners at preclinical or early clinical stages of development. Many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically disparate patient populations.    For the purposes of this NOFO, NINDS has defined small markets as development of novel products that:    Address a rare disease as defined in the Orphan Drug Act Amendment of 1984 as any disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States  Qualify as a Humanitarian Use Device, defined as a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 persons in the United States per year  Target a young pediatric population defined as including neonates (0-28 days), infants (<2 years), and/or children (2-12 years of age), as indicated in the FDA Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices.  Are tools intended for the neuroscience research market  The goal of this NOFO is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product/technology that requires Federal regulatory approval or to bring a complex research tool to market. To achieve this goal, the NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II projects to the commercialization stage by encouraging business relationships between NIH’s SBIR/STTR recipients  and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. In particular, this NOFO will give competitive preference and funding priority to applications deemed likely to result in a commercial product as indicated by an applicant's ability to secure partnerships within a broad range of potential third-parties.       Specific Objectives    Independent Third-Party Partners    This NOFO is specifically intended to encourage business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide substantial financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products and technologies initiated with NIH SBIR or STTR funding. In particular, applicants are expected to leverage their previous NIH SBIR or STTR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NINDS funding under this NOFO, to negotiate and attract third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant’s ability to secure funds will provide a measure of commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR applications submitted to this NOFO. This commercial potential will be strongly considered in making funding decisions. It is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party partners will involve a considerable level of project due diligence, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. Third-party partners include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an “angel” investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a state or local government, or any combination of the above. In light of these goals, the NINDS strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in the commercialization of emerging biomedical technologies.    NINDS expects companies working in small markets (as defined above) to secure independent third-party funding equal to or greater than one-third of the NINDS funds being requested throughout the project period. For all other projects, it is expected that the level of this independent third-party funding will be equal to or greater than the NINDS funds being requested throughout the Phase IIB Bridge Award project period.    Scientific/Technical Scope    The technical and commercial objectives described in the SBIR Phase IIB application must represent an extension of the development efforts that were pursued in a previously funded NIH SBIR or STTR Phase II grant or contract.    Examples of appropriate studies under thisNOFO  include, but are not limited to, those designed to:    Evaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in healthy volunteers or the target population.  Evaluate whether an intervention produces sufficient evidence of short-term activity (e.g., biomarker activity, target engagement, dose-response trends, pharmacodynamic response) in a human ""proof of concept"" trial.  Select or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy (e.g., futility trials).  For devices: Establish proof-of-principle and optimize techniques, operation, and usability of a device; inform the final device design decisions; and estimate the magnitude of treatment effect.  NINDS recognizes that devices can differ greatly in terms of basic form and function, physiological bases for therapy, degree of invasiveness, etc. A Pivotal device study, for example, could potentially be used in support of an off-label indication of an existing market approved device, or to provide evidence for a novel device design in support of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), 510(k) or 510(k) De Novo submission. Due to the broad scope of possible medical devices and the varied nature of the regulatory path, investigators considering applications to evaluate devices are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific/Research Staff as early as possible to discuss these issues and determine the suitability of their project for this funding mechanism.    NINDS, as part of NIH, strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, NINDS explicitly emphasizes the NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm) and provides additional guidance to the scientific community (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/grant_policy). For example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on a robust and rigorous scientific rationale, which means that data supporting the scientific rationale should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.    NIH strongly encourages applications from PDs/PIs from broadly diverse backgrounds to bring diverse perspectives to the research enterprise. Diversity within the NIH-supported scientific workforce fosters innovation, enhances global competitiveness, and improves the quality of research and research outcomes. NIH is committed to supporting a sustainable and diverse biomedical research workforce (see Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031).    Fostering and encouraging applications from socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses in technological innovation is one of the goals of the SBIR and STTR programs (https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf). To broaden the range of institutions training researchers entering the biomedical entrepreneurial workforce, NIH also strongly encourages applications with eligible PDs/PIs who are graduates or affiliates of institutions in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states or Resource-Limited Institutions. (See Notice of Special Interest: Encouraging Small Businesses to Partner with Resource-Limited Institutions (RLIs) on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Applications, NOT-OD-23-179.)    Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives    The NIH recognizes that teams comprised of investigators with diverse perspectives working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct viewpoints outperform homogeneous teams. There are many benefits that flow from a scientific workforce rich with diverse perspectives, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved populations participate in, and benefit from research, and enhancing public trust.    To support the best science, the NIH encourages inclusivity in research guided by the consideration of diverse perspectives. Broadly, diverse perspectives can include but are not limited to the educational background and scientific expertise of the people who perform the research; the populations who participate as human subjects in research studies; and the places where research is done.    This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP), which will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation.  Assessment of applications containing a PEDP are based on the scientific and technical merit of the proposed project. Consistent with federal law, the race, ethnicity, or sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation or transgender status) of a researcher, award participant, or trainee will not be considered during the application review process or when making funding decisions.  Applications that fail to include a PEDP will be considered incomplete and will be administratively withdrawn before review.    The PEDP will be submitted as Other Project Information as an attachment (see Section IV).  Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available PEDP guidance materials    Applicants should take note of the following:    (1) Consultation with NINDS: Applicants are encouraged to consult with NINDS Scientific/Research staff as plans for an application are being developed (see Section VII, Agency Contacts) and no later than 12 weeks prior to the anticipated application submission date. This early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify NINDS policies and guidelines as well as to discuss how to develop an appropriate project timeline and milestone plan, which is subject to peer review. As well, discussions regarding strategies for recruitment and inclusion of women, minorities, and participation of individuals across the lifespan as participants in research involving human subjects are available.    (2) Other Relevant Programs: NINDS supports several clinical trial networks specifically designed to implement multi-site clinical trials. See https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Clinical-Research for more information:    NeuroNEXT (http://www.neuronext.org): NINDS has a network called NeuroNEXT specifically designed to implement multicenter exploratory clinical trials (see https://www.neuronext.org/) and when appropriate, it is strongly preferred that such trials be performed within this network. Therefore, applying to this exploratory clinical trials NOFO, an applicant should follow the instructions on the above website to obtain feedback on the suitability of their trial for NeuroNEXT. An important advantage of NeuroNEXT is that it can provide clinical, statistical and logistical expertise in developing study protocols as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.    StrokeNet (http://www.nihstrokenet.org): NINDS has a network called StrokeNet specifically designed to implement multicenter exploratory and efficacy trials in stroke prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (see http://www.nihstrokenet.org/). NINDS requires that all large stroke trials be considered for StrokeNet. Only under exceptional circumstances will NINDS consider funding such trials outside of the StrokeNet program (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-14-043.html). An important advantage of StrokeNet is that it can provide clinical, statistical and logistical expertise in developing study protocols as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.    EPPIC-Net (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC ): The Early Phase Pain Investigation Clinical Network (EPPIC-Net) seeks to enhance the treatment of acute and chronic pain and reduce reliance on opioids by accelerating early-phase clinical trials of non-addictive treatments for pain. EPPIC-Net has the capacity to quickly and efficiently conduct many simultaneous multisite studies. The network will conduct studies on a variety of treatments, including drugs and devices, as well as studies to better understand pain. Successful asset applicants do not receive funding but rather receive access to EPPIC-Net resources for conduct of the clinical trial for their asset. Intellectual property and products studied within EPPIC-Net remain the property of the asset owner.    SIREN (https://siren.network/): NINDS supports the SIREN network which performs clinical trials that impact the care of the patient with a neurological emergency other than stroke in the pre-hospital or emergency department setting. NINDS requires that all such trials be first considered for the SIREN network, though the study PI may come from outside of the network. The study PI will work with the SIREN network to write the protocol and lead the operations committee for the trial.    Before submitting an application to this NOFO, applicants should consult with NINDS scientific/research staff to obtain feedback on the suitability of their trial for one of these networks. An important advantage of the networks is their capacity to provide clinical, statistical, and logistical expertise in developing study protocols, as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.    Trans-NIH Initiatives. NINDS participates in funding opportunities under the NIH HEAL Initiative® that support clinical trials focused on development of therapies and technologies directed at enhanced pain management. If eligible, companies are encouraged to apply through these funding opportunities. For more information visit: https://heal.nih.gov/.    NINDS Cooperative Agreement (U44) Translational Programs. NINDS has specific translational programs that utilize the SBIR cooperative agreement mechanism (U44), some of which allow preclinical and clinical trial activity within a single proposal. If eligible, companies are encouraged to apply through these programs. For more information visit: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Translational-Research.    (3) NIH Resources: As appropriate, applicants are encouraged to make use of the following resources for clinical research including:    Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa);  NeuroQOL (http://www.neuroqol.org);  NIH Toolbox (http://www.nihtoolbox.org);  PROMIS (http://www.nihpromis.org); and  NINDS Common Data Elements (http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov).  Applicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing NINDS research resources for their studies whenever possible. Such resources may include biospecimens from NINDS Human Biospecimen and Data Repository (BioSEND) or informatics system. The NINDS BioSEND repository receives, processes, stores, and distributes biospecimen resources from NINDS funded studies that can be shared by the neuroscience research community, and currently banks a variety of biospecimens including DNA, plasma, serum, RNA, CSF, and saliva. The NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository provides 1) disease-relevant stem cell lines for biomarker discovery, and/or 2) the capacity to bank blood for the creation of new cell lines relevant to their disease of interest. Leveraging the resources and support from neurological disorder advocacy groups, private research foundations, academic institutions, other government agencies and the NIH Intramural program are also encouraged. Finally, applicants are encouraged to leverage the resources of ongoing clinical trials supported through other Federal or private funds.    Applications proposing to collect biospecimens are strongly recommended to use the BioSEND protocols and procedures, and all specimens collected and banked with BioSEND must come from individuals who have consented to banking and sharing broadly with academia and industry. Note that costs for collection are NOT included as a component of the NINDS Biomarkers Repository award. Therefore, most costs for the biospecimen banking are borne by the recipients  utilizing this resource (see NOT-NS-15-046). Applicants planning projects in which biospecimens will be collected are strongly advised to consult the BioSEND website for more information about samples banked at the repository. In addition, applicants are advised to consult with BioSEND staff to obtain a quote for biospecimen banking costs (email: biosend@iu.edu).    (4) IRB documentation: IRB approval is not required at the time of application submission, but is required prior to funding. As such, NINDS encourages investigators to begin these processes as early as possible. NINDS also will require documentation of any other necessary regulatory approvals (e.g., Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee) prior to funding. Applicants are encouraged to review the NIH policy concerning single IRB for multisite clinical trials (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html and https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-076.html) as well as the sIRB requirement per the revised Common Rule at 45CFR46.114 https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/revised-common-rule-regulatory-text/index.html#46.114.    (5) Study Rationale: The rationale for a clinical trial must be based on (i) an unmet medical need; (ii) a plausible biological mechanism; and (iii) robust supporting data, e.g., from non-clinical (in vivo and/or in vitro data) studies or preliminary clinical studies that demonstrate there is an adequate scientific foundation to justify the proposed trial. The scientific premise for the trial should be based on preclinical and/or clinical data from rigorously performed studies (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-103.html). If previous research does not meet the rigor criteria outlined to an acceptable degree, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies.    (6) Efficacy: This NOFO is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy (although under certain circumstances, early studies of preliminary efficacy can be a secondary aim). While an exploratory clinical trial may examine clinical outcomes or biomarker outcomes as measures of ""preliminary efficacy"" as a secondary aim, it is important that it not appear to be an underpowered efficacy trial. Applications to implement definitive efficacy trials (e.g., Phase 3 trials of drugs or Pivotal device trials) should be submitted to PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials.    (7) Effect Size: A drug or biologic trial will not be considered for funding under this NOFO when its primary objective is to estimate intervention effect size to be used in power calculations for a future efficacy clinical trial. Effect size estimates based on small or short-term studies are often unreliable. Power for an efficacy trial should be based on the smallest clinically meaningful effect size, which is often determined by surveying physicians or patients, or by comparison to the effect produced by existing interventions.    (8) Ancillary studies: Ancillary studies, defined as research undertaken to address scientific questions relevant to the parent study and that require access to data or records from the parent study, and/or involve collection of additional data, specimens, or records, are not permitted within the clinical trial application. Applicants are advised to discuss their ideas with Scientific/Research staff for direction on an appropriate funding mechanism.    (9) Secondary Aims: For drugs and biologics, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures may be addressed as secondary aims in a clinical trial, but not as the primary aim. Examples of such secondary aims include:    Determining the optimal measure (endpoint), its variability, and/or the optimal timing of outcome evaluations in the context of the intervention  Collecting information on the utility of questionnaires, rating scales, or biomarkers  Developing and refining data collection procedures  Optimizing the administration of the study intervention  Developing and refining standardized methods of assessing outcome  Optimizing methods for identifying, recruiting, and retaining study participants  For Early Feasibility or Traditional Feasibility studies of medical devices, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures are expected to be addressed as primary aims in addition to providing initial clinical safety data at this stage. These may include:    Identifying appropriate modifications to the procedure or device to enable a subsequent Pivotal study on a finalized system  Refining the intended use population  Developing and refining data collection procedures  Refining the non-clinical test plans or methodologies  Developing subsequent clinical study protocols  (10) Multiple Trials: There may be several questions to be answered before a phase 3 efficacy trial can be designed and conducted. The proposed study is not required to address all potential questions, but the applicant should clearly detail the overall clinical development plan for the intervention, which could involve more than one exploratory trial.    (11) Innovative Designs: The use of innovative and efficient study designs is encouraged, such as adaptive dose-finding designs, designs incorporating plans for sample size recalculation, preliminary efficacy for devices, and futility designs. Applications for Phase 1 trials in the patient population are encouraged when appropriate (e.g., certain rare diseases), as are applications that encompass Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (early proof of mechanism or proof of concept). Applications Phase 3 trials should be submitted under PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. For medical devices, Traditional Feasibility study designs may include, for example, single-arm studies, on-off interventions (patients as their own controls), device-device comparisons, device-drug comparisons, comparisons to historical controls, comparisons to performance criteria/goals, adaptive designs, and Bayesian designs.    (12) Pharmacometrics: Applications seeking to obtain data needed for pharmacometric modeling are encouraged, with the aim of enabling the optimal design of a future efficacy trial of an intervention.    (13) Innovative Technologies: Applicants are encouraged to consider utilizing (at least experimentally) digital/mobile/sensor technologies and web-based systems to facilitate data collection (including data collection in a continual, contextual, real-world setting rather than through a traditional milestone-based approach), as well as to enhance protocol adherence.    (14) Rare Diseases: Trials in rare diseases are encouraged, particularly in conditions for which definitive outcome measures and prior data from natural history studies are available. It is recognized that available patient pools may not be adequate to meet the sample size requirements typically seen in trials in more common disorders of the nervous system, and innovative trial designs, including crossover designs and adaptive designs, can be appropriately considered. Additionally, an assessment of clinical efficacy as a secondary outcome may be warranted for rare diseases where the available patient pool may not make a definitive efficacy trial feasible. Regardless of the design it is especially important to ensure that the study design and statistical analysis plans will meet the stated objectives and allow for the most efficient evaluation of the limited subjects. The application should clearly demonstrate recruitment feasibility at the participating site and applicants are encouraged to fully engage patient advocacy groups or similar representatives of the affected disease community in study design, execution, and reporting.    (15) Relationships with Patient Groups: Applicants are strongly encouraged to establish relationships with patient groups and solicit their input on recruitment, the clinical meaningfulness of the question under study, the relevance of the proposed clinical outcomes, and approaches to minimizing the burden on study subjects    Applications Not-Responsive to this NOFO:    Non-responsive applications will not be reviewed.    Applications for Phase 3 trials and other trials where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy. These projects should be submitted under PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials.  Trials where the primary objective is to estimate intervention effect size to be used in power calculations for a future efficacy clinical trial.  Multi-site clinical trials with more than three clinical sites. These trials may be supported through NINDS clinical trial networks, such as StrokeNet (http://www.nihstrokenet.org), NeuroNEXT (http://www.neuronext.org) and EPPIC-Net (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC).  Preclinical activities to support filing of an IND or IDE followed by clinical trial activities supported by this IND/IDE.  See Section VIII.

"PHS 2024-2 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC and FDA for Small Business Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44] Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","Background  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with their mission to improve health and save lives.  As described by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the statutory purpose of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is to strengthen the role of innovative small business concerns (SBCs) in federally-funded research or research and development. The purpose of the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program is to stimulate a partnership of ideas and technologies between innovative SBCs and non-profit Research Institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their extramural research budget to the SBIR program, and those with extramural research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside an additional 0.45% to the STTR program.  Purpose  This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II, Direct to Phase II (NIH Only), Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase IIB (NIH only) grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PA-24-247 or PAR-24-248.  SBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a ""Renewal"" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.  NIH Fast-Track: An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  NIH Direct to Phase II: For small businesses that have already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but have not received a Phase I SBIR or STTR for that project, NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award. The NIH will accept Direct to Phase II applications regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Direct to Phase II awards should be submitted as “New” applications and not continuations (""Renewal"") of Phase I SBIR or STTR projects.  NIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR or STTR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed Phase IIB project. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants must provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors. NIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR NOFOs or other specific NOFOs, are listed in the current SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. Additional requirements and instructions (e.g., submission of a letter of intent) are available in the specific IC research topics section and in the NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities that allow Phase IIB applications.  Specific Objectives  The SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA represent scientific program areas that may be of interest to applicant small businesses in the development of projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise to contribute to the R&D mission(s) of the NIH, CDC, or FDA awarding components identified in this NOFO are encouraged to submit SBIR grant applications in these areas. SBIR grant applications will also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the Components of Participating Organizations listed for this NOFO. In addition to the general SBIR solicitations, some awarding components have additional, specific NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities of potential interest to small businesses.  Applicants are not required to identify a potential awarding component prior to submission of the application but may request one on the Assignment Request Form. Staff within the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point for all NIH, CDC, and FDA grant applications, will assign all applications to the most appropriate Agency and Institute/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science proposed. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices website.  All applications submitted to this Parent Notice of Funding Opportunity are not allowed to propose clinical trial(s). SBIR applications that propose clinical trial(s) should be submitted to PA-24-246.  Further information about the SBIR and STTR programs can be found at https://seed.nih.gov.

"PHS 2024-2 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH for Small Business Technology Transfer Grant Applications (Parent STTR [R41/R42] Clinical Trial Required)","Background  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with their mission to improve health and save lives.  As described by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the statutory purpose of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is to strengthen the role of innovative small business concerns (SBCs) in federally-funded research or research and development. The purpose of the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program is to stimulate a partnership of ideas and technologies between innovative SBCs and non-profit Research Institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their extramural research budget to the SBIR program, and those with extramural research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside an additional 0.45% to the STTR program.  Purpose  This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I, Phase II, Fast-Track, and Phase IIB grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an SBIR grant application should submit to PA-24-245 and PA-24-246  SBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a ""Renewal"" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.  NIH Fast-Track: An NIH STTR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  NIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR or STTR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed Phase IIB project. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants must provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors. NIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR NOFOor other specific NOFOs, are listed in the SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA.

"NIAID SBIR Phase II Clinical Trial Implementation Cooperative Agreement (U44 Clinical Trial Required)","Purpose  This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant applications from small business concerns (SBCs) that propose to implement investigator-initiated clinical trials, including mechanistic studies associated with clinical trials.    This program provides support for milestone-driven, hypothesis-driven clinical trials related to the research mission of the NIAID that address a research area considered high priority by the Institute. Applicants seeking a Phase IIB renewal must have received an eligible predicate award that is appropriate and relevant (e.g., pre-clinical studies, planning activities, etc.) to this NOFO.    Although clinical trials not considered high-risk (see NOT-AI-21-037) may be proposed, this program encourages high-risk clinical studies. High-risk does not imply human subject or patient risk, but rather defines a study that contains one or more of the following unique attributes: involves non-routine interventions, administration of an unlicensed product, or administration of a licensed product for an unapproved indication. Additionally, mechanistic studies are encouraged and can be proposed under this program. Applicants may not propose more than one clinical trial per application.    Background        Over the past three years, NIAID has committed over $5.5 billion to clinical research, of which $2.5 billion was devoted to clinical trials and supportive activities. Clinical trials are one research strategy NIAID uses to improve the understanding of the clinical mechanisms of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases or to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. For additional information about the mission, strategic plan, and research interests of the NIAID, applicants are encouraged to consult the NIAID website https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/role.    NIAID Supported Clinical Trials and Infrastructure    Historically, NIAID supports both infrastructure and networks through a variety of funding mechanisms.

"Analytical Validation of a Candidate Biomarker for Neurological or Neuromuscular Disorders (U44 Clinical Trial Optional)","Background  A biomarker is a defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of a normal biological process, pathogenic process, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions. Biomarker modalities are diverse, and can include ‘omics, imaging, behavioral, digital and physiologic endpoints. Because the measurement of the biomarker is integral to defining the biomarker, it is necessary to describe the biomarker in terms of its biological source or matrix, measurable features, and the analytic method used to measure it (“detection method”).  Biomarkers are critical to the discovery and development of therapeutics and can serve a variety of functions such as verifying therapeutic target engagement, improving trial design by patient stratification, and facilitating clinical care decisions. Despite the active pace of discovery of novel biomarker candidates, few biomarkers progress beyond discovery to the robust analytical and clinical validation needed for use in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Thus, there is a critical need to advance validation of biomarkers to improve public health, particularly for disorders of the nervous system where advancing therapeutics from discovery to the market are notoriously challenging. Validation of biomarkers for all neurological and neuromuscular disorders within NINDS’ mission and across the age spectrum are within scope.  This NOFO is intended to address the gap in biomarker validation by encouraging rigorous analytical validation of the biomarker detection method for one or two specified context(s) of use.  Definitions of terms used in this NOFO :  Context of Use (COU): A statement that fully and clearly describes the way the biomarker is expected to be used. The COU should include the biomarker category (susceptibility/risk, diagnostic, monitoring, prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic/response, or safety), the modality, method of detection, and clinical population characteristics. Context of use statements are discussed extensively in the Framework for Defining Evidentiary Criteria for Biomarker Qualification developed by the Biomarkers Consortium: https://fnih.org/sites/default/files/final/pdf/Evidentiary%20Criteria%20Framework%20Final%20Version%20Oct%2020%202016.pdf Concept: In a regulatory context, the concept is the aspect of an individual’s clinical, biological, physical, or functional state, or experience that the assessment is intended to indicate or reflect. Detection method: The method(s) used for measuring the biomarker(s). Analytical Validation: A process to establish that the performance characteristics of a test, tool, or instrument are acceptable in terms of its sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and other relevant performance characteristics using a specified technical protocol (which may include specimen collection, handling and storage procedures). This is validation of the test’s, tool’s, or instrument’s technical performance to measure the biomarker(s) of interest. Clinical Validation: A process to establish that the test, tool, or instrument acceptably identifies, measures or predicts the concept of interest. Clinical validation establishes the data needed to support conclusions or interpret the results of the biomarker(s) readout, and the level of confidence for these interpretations. Composite biomarkers/biomarker signatures: when more than one biomarker is being validated for the same context of use (e.g., a panel of biomarkers, or set of features used as a composite indicator). Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA): a measure that describes or reflects how a patient feels, functions, or survives (includes patient-reported outcomes, observer-reported outcomes, clinician-reported outcomes, and performance outcomes). Digital Biomarker: The term “digital biomarker” is widely used to mean assessments that include both biological processes (such as changes in heart rate or galvanic skin response) as well as performance assessments (such as measurements derived from accelerometers). Both digital biomarkers and digital performance assessment are within scope of this NOFO, however other patient-reported outcomes, observer-reported outcomes, and clinician reported outcomes are not within scope. Biomarker categories as defined in the Biomarkers, EndpointS, and Other Tools (BEST) Resources (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK338448/) include:  Monitoring biomarkers to track the success of a therapeutic intervention or the disease progression Diagnostic biomarkers used to detect or confirm presence of a disease or condition of interest or to identify individuals with a subtype of the disease. Prognostic biomarkers for predicting outcomes Predictive biomarkers for differentiating individuals based on favorable or unfavorable effect from a therapeutic or other intervention Pharmacodynamic/response biomarker that indicates biologic activity of a medical product or environmental agent without necessarily drawing conclusions about efficacy or disease outcome or necessarily linking this activity to an established mechanism of action. Safety biomarkers to indicate the likelihood, presence, or extent of an adverse effect Susceptibility/risk biomarkers that indicate the potential for developing a disease or medical condition in an individual who does not currently have a clinically apparent disease. Research Objectives  This NOFO supports research to conduct analytical validation of the detection method for a biomarker or biomarker signature or composite biomarker for one or two specified context(s) of use. Premise for the utility of the biomarker(s) should include evidence that the biomarker/biomarker signature/composite has undergone preliminary testing in an appropriate clinical population, using either prospective or retrospective data or samples, and shows sufficient clinical sensitivity and specificity and/or association with the biological concept of interest to warrant additional investment.  In addition, applications to this NOFO should include evidence that the detection method for the biomarker has already been developed and subjected to initial evaluation of precision and analytical sensitivity. This NOFO supports research that clearly describes how the proposed study plans to optimize and standardize the detection method, as well as clearly define and rigorously test the analytic and pre-analytic variables to evaluate and reduce sources of variability when measuring the biomarker.  Earlier stage research that still needs to conduct clinical proof of concept studies to establish the relationship between candidate biomarkers with a concept of interest (with or without detection method development) should consider applying to the companion NOFO, PAR-22-089 “Development of Biomarkers or Biomarker Signatures for Neurological and Neuromuscular Disorders”. Alternatively, studies that are seeking to conduct final clinical validation research using detection methods that have already been extensively analytically validated for the proposed context of use should consider the companion NOFO “Clinical Validation of Biomarkers for Neurological and Neuromuscular conditions”.  The Analytical Validation NOFOs and companion Clinical Validation NOFOs are designed to help gather the data package needed for clinical trial readiness and may be used to support a submission to the FDA’s Biomarker Qualification Submission or to the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.  For more information on the Biomarker Qualification program see: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DrugDevelopmentToolsQualificationProgram/BiomarkerQualificationProgram/default.htm  Application Characteristics  A strong justification for use of the proposed detection method and biomarker including clinical and/or research unmet need should be included. Feasibility, including potential added clinical burden and cost should also be directly addressed. The status of the existing detection method and the plan for its optimization in clinical laboratories or point of care settings should be described. The project should include analytical validation in multiple testing sites. If a single site is proposed, a scientific justification should be included. Milestones describing the metrics for evaluating analytical validation to assess success in achieving each of the research plan’s objectives must be included. Although an individual indicator may be useful as more than one category of biomarker (i.e. both diagnostic and monitoring) the type of evidence required to validate it depends on the biomarker category specified; for example, a monitoring biomarker would need to demonstrate robustness in a longitudinal study design whereas a diagnostic may be evaluated at a cross sectional design. Thus, defining the biomarker category(ies) is essential to developing the experimental design and analytical performance necessary to validate it.  The research strategy should clearly describe how the application will utilize a rigorous design, execution, and interpretation of the proposed studies. NINDS encourages investigators, whenever possible, to address these elements directly in their applications. Analytical Validation should include the following metrics with use of FDA guidance standards appropriate for the Context of Use  Accuracy Precision Analytical sensitivity Analytical specificity including interfering substances or signals Reportable range of test results for the test system Reference intervals (normal values) with controls and calibrators Harmonization of analytical performance of the detection method to be performed in multiple laboratories Establishment of appropriate quality control and improvement procedures Any other performance characteristics necessary for establishing calibration and control procedures Collaborations  Multi-disciplinary collaboration among scientific investigators, developers, clinicians, statisticians, consultants, and clinical laboratory staff are an integral part of the application. Projects proposed for this NOFO should utilize multi-site design as applicable, with standardized data stewardship to ensure reproducibility and reliability across users and operators.  Investigators are encouraged to form collaborations with individuals knowledgeable in the FDA qualification process as well as those familiar with the process of analytical validation, including statistical design and analysis experts.  Leveraging Existing Resources  Where applicable, applicants are encouraged to leverage existing research resources for their studies. Such resources may include clinical biospecimen samples from the NINDS Human Biospecimen and Data Repository (BioSEND; https://biosend.org/) or other existing biospecimen, imaging and data repositories. Leveraging the resources of ongoing clinical trials or clinical studies supported through other Federal or private funds is also encouraged.  Project Milestones  A project timeline with annual milestones must be included in the application (see Section IV). Milestones should describe project decision points with results-driven, quantitative metrics for go/no-go decision making throughout the funding period.  The NIH Program Official will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones prior to the award. Under this Cooperative Agreement mechanism, NINDS Program Staff will have substantial communication and involvement with researchers in decision-making prior to award and during the conduct of the study to provide oversight of data and safety monitoring, ensure the timely completion of the proposed studies and to maximize the positive impact of the studies on upcoming clinical trials. The Program Officer and Scientific Officer will discuss with the Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) any recommended changes to the research plan or suggestions from peer review, and the plan and milestones may be revised as appropriate prior to the award.  Rigor, Reproducibility, Data Sharing and Intellectual Property  NINDS, as part of NIH, strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, NINDS explicitly emphasizes the NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm) and provides additional guidance to the scientific community (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/grant_policy). For example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on rigorous and robust supporting data, which means that data should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.  To improve reproducibility and community uptake, investigators are generally expected to share code/scripts, analytic tools/statistical models, protocols/processes and metadata before the end of the project’s period of performance. If there is a plan to commercialize aspects of the project such as analytic software, applicants should consult with their tech transfer office when developing the data sharing plan and intellectual property plan.  Budgets should reflect any costs associated with these efforts. Information on many available NIH supported or frequently used repositories is available at: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html  Applicants collecting biofluid samples from prospectively enrolled study participants are encouraged to share samples through the NINDS biomarker repository, BioSEND (https://biosend.org/ ) to provide the broader scientific community with a data resource for hypothesis generation and test validation. Applicants should contact BioSEND to incorporate sharing plans and cost in their application.  Pre-Application Consultation  Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with NINDS Program Staff early on during the planning for an application. This early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify NINDS policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the NINDS mission and intent of this NOFO. These discussions can also provide any needed clarification regarding development of an appropriate timeline and milestone plan.  Funding Considerations  Applications within the top scoring meritorious range will be considered for funding. Within that range, priority may be placed on applications that fill a critical program gap to ensure biomarker development that is reflective of the breadth of disorders and conditions within NINDS’s mission. Additionally, priority will be given to biomarkers that: 1) address an unmet medical need, 2) are supported by a strong biological rationale, 3) include a carefully designed plan for performance evaluation, 4) include a plan for standardization of samples and data collection for use in validation and 5) provide a strong justification for the utility of the biomarker in the clinical setting or for use in clinical trial design.  Non-responsive applications will be administratively withdrawn without review.  See Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.

A clear and feasible timeline with quantitative annual milestones that demonstrate continued feasibility and progress towards the project’s success (see section IV “Other Project Information”) A team management plan (see section IV “Other Project Information”) If applicable, an Intellectual Property (IP) plan (see section IV “Other Project Information”) Clinical Validation should include the following metrics with use of FDA guidance standards appropriate for the Context of Use  Sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker within the Context of Use, including methods for binary and/or continuous analysis. Area Under the Curve (AUC) as determined by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Analysis Estimation of the prevalence of the marker within subjects or patients for the intended clinical context. Establishing the appropriate thresholds or reference ranges for the biomarker for decision making within the context of use. Positive Predictive Value (the probability that a positive screening test result is true, taking into account the prevalence of the disease or condition in the population being measured). Negative Predictive Value (the probability that a negative screening test result is true, taking into account the prevalence of the disease or condition in the population being measured). Collaborations and Consultants  Multidisciplinary collaboration among scientific investigators, clinical scientists, disease/biology matter experts, statisticians, regulatory expertise, and other academic/industry experts relevant to the context of use in the application as well as clinical and laboratory staff are an integral part of the application.  Investigators are also encouraged to form collaborations/obtain consultants with individuals knowledgeable in relevant regulatory processes and/or statisticians knowledgeable in clinical trial design.  Leveraging Existing Resources  Where applicable, applicants are encouraged to leverage existing research resources for their studies. Such resources may include clinical biospecimen samples from the NINDS Human Biospecimen and Data Repository (BioSEND; https://biosend.org/) or other existing biospecimen, imaging and data repositories. Leveraging the resources of ongoing clinical trials or clinical studies supported through other Federal or private funds is also encouraged.  Rigor, Reproducibility, Data Sharing and Intellectual Property  NINDS, as part of NIH, strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, NINDS explicitly emphasizes the NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm) and provides additional guidance to the scientific community (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/grant_policy). For example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on rigorous and robust supporting data, which means that data should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.  To improve reproducibility and community uptake, investigators are generally expected to share code/scripts, analytic tools/statistical models, protocols/processes and metadata before the end of the project’s period of performance. If there is a plan to commercialize aspects of the project such as analytic software, applicants should consult with their tech transfer office when developing the data sharing plan and intellectual property plan.  Budgets should reflect any costs associated with these efforts. Information on many available NIH supported or frequently used repositories is available at: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html  Applicants collecting biofluid samples from prospectively enrolled study participants are encouraged to share samples through the NINDS biomarker repository, BioSEND (https://biosend.org/ ) to provide the broader scientific community with a data resource for hypothesis generation and test validation. Applicants should contact BioSEND to incorporate sharing plans and cost in their application.  Pre-Application Consultation  Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with NINDS Program Staff early on during the planning for an application. This early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify NINDS policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the NINDS mission and intent of this NOFO. These discussions can also provide any needed clarification regarding development of an appropriate timeline and milestone plan and guidance for requesting approval of budgets that exceed $500,000 direct cost in any given year.  Funding Considerations  Applications within the top scoring meritorious range will be considered for funding. Within that range, priority may be placed on applications that fill a critical program gap to ensure biomarker development that is reflective of the breadth of disorders and conditions within NINDS’s mission. Additionally, priority will be given to biomarkers that: 1) address an unmet medical need, 2) are supported by a strong biological rationale, 3) include a carefully designed plan for performance evaluation, 4) include a plan for standardization of samples and data collection for use in validation and 5) provide a strong justification for the utility of the biomarker in the clinical setting or for use in clinical trial design.  Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO  Non-responsive studies include:  clinical trials or clinical research where the primary intent is to develop therapeutic agents or devices, clinical trials or clinical research to evaluate a therapeutic agent or device’s clinical safety, efficacy, effectiveness, and/or clinical management, pre-clinical research using animal models, applications where the primary intent is to validate clinical outcome assessments rather than biomarkers, applications that do not specify the context(s) of use, applications that do not include milestones, applications that are not within the NINDS mission STTR applications will not be accepted. Non-responsive applications will be administratively withdrawn without review  See Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.

"Seeking Products to Address Social Needs impacting Substance Use Disorders (SUD) (R41/R42 Clinical Trial Optional)","Purpose  The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support applications from small business concerns (SBCs) to develop technologies for commercialization to address health-related social needs that impact substance use disorders (SUD), excluding alcohol use disorder.  Background  In 2021, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) noted that 61 million people ages 12 and older used illicit drugs in the past year. Nationwide, the Association of American Medical Colleges has reported 21 million people with a SUD, and just 11% of them received treatment. With so many individuals struggling with SUD, and very few receiving treatment, the SUD crisis will worsen. It will take a more comprehensive approach to address the crisis; including addressing the individual's health-related social needs (HRSN) that are influenced by their living conditions.  The health of people struggling with SUD is inextricably bound to their social environment. Social determinants of health (SDH) can directly shape health risk behaviors. Moreover, public health experts have long recognized the impact of SDH on health outcomes. While SDH are seen as the surrounding conditions of people’s existence, HRSN are the individual’s unique social conditions from five core categories established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Accountable Health Communities Model (housing instability, food insecurity, nonmedical transportation, utility needs, and personal safety) resulting from fundamental SDH. SDH manifest in the living conditions and resources that indirectly exacerbate the consequences of drug use. For example, inadequate housing can increase the likelihood of infectious disease transmission, stable social relationships can offer protective financial and emotional resources, and more cohesive neighborhoods are more likely to provide appropriate support and care. HRSN are displayed as people struggling with SUD being able to pay their utility bills while living in inadequate housing, being able to purchase food without sacrificing money for rent, and being able to navigate their community without concern for their personal safety. While SDH, such as poverty, homelessness, and incarceration, among others, impact behaviors that lead to SUD, being able to identify and address the unique HRSN of people struggling with SUD, by using technology, can serve as a catalyst to filling the service gaps that government and the medical community cannot do alone. The public and private sectors, utilizing the infinite capabilities of technology, can collaborate to create new paths and form new business models to address the many direct health-related social needs of people already struggling with SUD.  Research Objectives  A variety of products addressing the individual-level factors of HRSN should be considered to confront SUD. Additionally, technology, such as telemedicine and mobile health applications, provide an opportunity to address HRSN with the ability to provide tested, accessible, and ongoing solutions for individuals who are the most at-risk for these risk factors that impact SUD. According to SAMHSA, technology has several advantages in addressing SUD including decreased waiting periods, decreased stigma impact and increased privacy. The advantages of technology are also exhibited in its capability to make treatment services more accessible and convenient, which can aid to improve SUD outcomes and reduce disparities.  Regarding this NOFO, a product is any source of value for the end-users and customers. A product can be a physical/tangible device as well as digital services, software as a service, or non-physical/non-tangible products (including but not limited to digital applications, digital platforms, or service models). These and other comparable examples could be considered eligible products. Products can be the result of original scientific research, recycled existing technology for SUD, extension of an observation into SUD area, development of a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that reveals currently unseen value, or the delivery of a product or service to disregarded consumers.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) supports the development of evidence-based SUD care and treatment technology from multiple funding opportunities published elsewhere. The eligible small businesses can submit applications focusing on products that reduce costs, time, and/or increase access in addressing HRSN including, but not limited to, housing instability, non-medical transportation, food insecurity, utility needs, and personal safety. The products should provide the best feasible and accessible opportunities for the intended end-users to measurably improve their HRSN and SUD. Products of interest that address, but are not limited to, the following HRSN include:  Access to housing services. Soft skills development and/or job training (e.g., in entrepreneurship, literacy, financial literacy, IT skills) for employment. Stigma and nurture compassion. Family healthy behaviors, social skills, community opportunities, and productive social involvement. Social stability (community, tradition, faith, family), self-regulation, and resilience. Well-being (mental, physical, spiritual), communal belonging, and positive productivity. Social support networks for recovery, engagement with care, and/or access to needed services. Successful community reintegration for formerly incarcerated people. Social needs service engagement and coordination among justice-involved organizations. Employer education to hire, retain, and facilitate treatment for employees seeking help for SUD. Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO  The following will be deemed not responsive and will be returned without review  Applications solely focused on the research and development of solutions to provide medical care and/or treatment. Applications focusing solely on health-related social needs in the context of Alcohol Use Disorders. The SBIR/STTR program is a phased program.  The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization.  An overall objective of the SBIR and STTR programs is to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federally supported research and development. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, the small business is expected to fully commercialize its product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal).  Three types of applications are accepted in response to this NOFO:  Phase I. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization prior to proceeding to Phase II.  Fast-Track (Phase I/ Phase II) applications should include a clear rationale of the feasibility of the proposed approach and/ or technology application in SUD area; demonstrate a high probability of commercialization; propose clear, appropriate, meaningful, and measurable goals (milestones) to be achieved prior to initiating Phase II; and indicate potential Phase III support/interest (non-SBIR/STTR) from future commercialization partners.  An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  Phase II. The objective of Phase II (as a part of Fast Track applications) is to continue the R&D efforts initiated in Phase I to advance technologies to potential commercialization. Projects proposed for Phase II are based on the results achieved in Phase I (or equivalent) and aim to demonstrate scientific and technical merit and commercial potential. NIDA seeks to determine that both technical feasibility and commercial feasibility are established in Phase I before making the decision about proceeding to Phase II.  Special Considerations  NIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards. Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.  See Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.

"Miniaturization and Automation of Tissue Chip Systems (MATChS) (UT1/UT2 - Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","Background  This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I, Phase II, and Fast-Track grant applications. The funding opportunity will utilize a UT1/UT2 cooperative agreement to support small business concerns (SBCs) to propose applications to create bench top, portable, automated, self-contained systems that maintain 3D tissue constructs (e.g., precise thermal control, fluid pumping and sampling) and provide biologically relevant outputs of tissue health and function. The companion Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) NOFO allows for submission of Phase I, Phase II, Fast-Track, and Direct to Phase II grant applications.  NCATS has consistently shown leadership in the development of tissue chip technology, in the demonstration of its utility in drug development for safety, efficacy and precision medicine, and in the dissemination of the technology (https://ncats.nih.gov/tissuechip/about). FDA Modernization Act 2.0 declared that the FDA no longer requires animal tests before drug trials in humans, which stimulated increased interest in in vitro New Approach Methods (NAMs) that are more predictive of human response in the safety and efficacy assessment of leading therapeutics. Tissue/organs on chips systems are considered as one of the NAMs. However, the widespread dissemination of tissue chip technology is hindered by the relatively large and complex instrumentation system needed to support the function of the chips, low throughput and specialized expertise needed to operate the systems. The instrumentation typically requires a multidisciplinary team of biomedical engineers and microfluidics experts to assure smooth operations, and biologists to acquire and analyze the data. This underscores the need for improvements in design towards systems capable of real-time, repeated measurements, with ease of manufacturability, and broader user-friendliness.  Through partnerships between NCATS, NASA and the Center for Advancement of Science in Space, the Tissue Chips in Space program has enabled advances in the study of microgravity-associated age?related conditions and has made key technological improvements in the tissue chips instrumentation systems towards automation and miniaturization required for space flight. This Miniaturization and Automation of Tissue Chip Systems (MATCHs) NOFO seeks to translate the lessons learned from the Tissue Chips in Space program in engineering tissue chip platforms towards a smaller footprint and the simplification of systems for ease of use. Previously, NASA has partnered with NIH, BARDA and FDA to develop extended longevity tissue chips (cell culture life up to 6 months) with a focus on the development of systems requiring minimal human intervention. Working with spaceflight payload implementation partners, NCATS-supported tissue chip investigators have developed compact, robust, and reliable platforms which integrate basic support systems (incubation, refrigeration, thermal control, fluid reservoirs, microfluidic pumping systems etc.) as well as technologies to monitor cell health and function (pH, gas concentrations, repeated fluid sampling, microscopy, electrophysiology etc.). This Miniaturization and Automation of Tissue Chip Systems (MATCHs) NOFO seeks to engineer tissue chip platforms towards a smaller footprint and the simplification of systems for ease of use that will result in ease of use and broader accessibility of tissue chips in drug discovery and biomedical research.  Objectives  This NOFO seeks to fund technology development research efforts in instrumentation innovation and approaches for automation and miniaturization of MPS. The technology development proposed should have the potential to significantly propel the field of MPS forward and have the potential to have a large impact on the future analysis of safety and efficacy assessment of therapeutics. A main objective for this funding opportunity would be to create a bench top, portable, easy-to-use, automated MPS with integrated in-line sensors, flow generator with system control and data processing software to provide rapid and reproducible high-throughput analysis. The project could integrate manual methods into an automated system to develop a standalone module. Improved tissue chips instrumentation systems should demonstrate automation capabilities in maintaining culture without external intervention and can be monitored remotely through real-time biosensing and readout capabilities, including telemetry operations. Automation may include automation of tissue preculture and loading, system operation, perfusion systems with or without pumps, automation of cell culture conditions, monitoring and sensing, include in-line sensors, e.g., pressure, pH and oxygen sensors. This self-contained system should maintain 3D tissue constructs (via precise thermal control, fluid pumping and sampling) for extended periods of time and provide biologically relevant outputs of tissue health and function (e.g., by means of fluid sampling, electrode incorporation, microscopy, biosensors). If automated chip exchange is proposed, the system should have proper optical, mechanical, and electrical couplings. The fabrication procedure must be cost effective, mass producible, and robust. The application may include development of a software for instrument control, data acquisition and real-time detection, fast data processing and analysis for high throughput measurements.  Performance metrics of an integrated system for a multi-day protocol should be developed once standard protocols are established and instrument performance is assessed. Once optimal assay parameters are identified, and optimized chips created and integrated for use in the fully automated system with alignment features ensuring proper connection of the fluidic path to the chip, the performance of the system should be characterized and validated. An automated system may be validated by demonstrating compatibility with developed chips and organ-on a chip model and by pre-market end-user testing.  The NOFO deliberately does not specify cost, quality, scale, sensitivity, dynamic range, throughput, or other key metrics since achievable endpoints are likely to substantially differ from one technology to another. However, the applicant must propose quantitative metrics so progress can be evaluated and present convincing rationale that the proposed technology has the potential to scale long-term and to achieve a throughput compatible with widespread adoption by the biomedical and clinical research community. It is expected that applicants will develop and detail scientific and practical definitions of optimal throughput, cost, accuracy, sensitivity, dynamic range, and scale. The long-term goal is to achieve technological advances that enable generation of data at sufficient scale, speed, cost and accuracy to use routinely in safety and efficacy assessment of therapeutics. MATChS is expected to accelerate commercialization and catalyze the widespread use of tissue chips through automation and miniaturization of the instrumentation systems and will lead to the general utility of tissue chips in drug development and regulatory decision-making, as well as in biomedical research in general as a major research tool.  The STTR U1/U2 cooperative agreement mechanism is milestone-driven and involves significant input from NIH program staff regarding project and milestone planning, monitoring of research progress, and go/no-go decision-making. Applicants are encouraged to contact staff at NCATS per Agency Contacts below to ensure that their study design and objectives are in line with the goals of the NOFO. Award recipients will be expected to work with NCATS staff post-award.  Examples of responsive activities and corresponding STTR Phase assignment includes but is not limited to the following technological developments:  STTR Phase I (UT1)  Development of components of the system Development of real-time biosensing Development of automated readout capabilities Telemetry operations Automation of tissue preculture and loading Automation of system operation Development of perfusion systems Development of automation to maintain 3D tissue STTR Phase II (UT2)  Integration of the system Development of a stand-alone instrument prototype Militarization of the system Development of software for instrument control and data processing software Standard protocols Assessment of instrument performance System characterization and validation Pre-market end-user testing UT2 Phase I/II Transition  Applicants can submit separate Phase 1 (UT1) or Phase II (UT2) applications. However, if Phase I and Phase II are submitted together in one application (UT2 Fast-Track), then an administrative review will be conducted by NCATS Program staff to decide whether a project will be considered for transition from the Phase I to Phase II. Phase II eligible projects must successfully accomplish milestones of Phase 1 as defined in Milestones Plan. Funding for the Phase II application will be contingent upon (1) assessment of the Phase I progress report and determination that the Phase I goals and milestones were achieved; (2) an update (as necessary) of the Commercialization Plan; (3) determination of the project's potential for meeting the mission of the awarding component and for commercial success; (4) review and approval of other documents necessary for continuation; and (5) availability of funds. The continuation application package is due 2 months prior to the anticipated start date of Phase II.

Once optimal assay parameters are identified, and optimized chips created and integrated for use in the fully automated system with alignment features ensuring proper connection of the fluidic path to the chip, the performance of the system should be characterized and validated. An automated system may be validated by demonstrating compatibility with developed chips and organ-on a chip model and by pre-market end-user testing.  The NOFO deliberately does not specify cost, quality, scale, sensitivity, dynamic range, throughput, or other key metrics since achievable endpoints are likely to substantially differ from one technology to another. However, the applicant must propose quantitative metrics so progress can be evaluated and present convincing rationale that the proposed technology has the potential to scale long-term and to achieve a throughput compatible with widespread adoption by the biomedical and clinical research community. It is expected that applicants will develop and detail scientific and practical definitions of optimal throughput, cost, accuracy, sensitivity, dynamic range, and scale. The long-term goal is to achieve technological advances that enable generation of data at sufficient scale, speed, cost and accuracy to use routinely in safety and efficacy assessment of therapeutics. MATChS is expected to accelerate commercialization and catalyze the widespread use of tissue chips through automation and miniaturization of the instrumentation systems and will lead to the general utility of tissue chips in drug development and regulatory decision-making, as well as in biomedical research in general as a major research tool.  The SBIR U43/U44 cooperative agreement mechanism is milestone-driven and involves significant input from NIH program staff regarding project and milestone planning, monitoring of research progress, and go/no-go decision-making. Applicants are encouraged to contact staff at NCATS per Agency Contacts below to ensure that their study design and objectives are in line with the goals of the NOFO. Award recipients will be expected to work with NCATS staff post-award.  Examples of responsive activities and corresponding SBIR Phase assignment includes but is not limited to the following technological developments.  SBIR Phase I (U43)  Development of components of the system Development of real-time biosensing Development of automated readout capabilities Telemetry operations Automation of tissue preculture and loading Automation of system operation Development of perfusion systems Development of automation to maintain 3D tissue  SBIR Phase II (U44) Integration of the system Development of a stand-alone instrument prototype Militarization of the system Development of software for instrument control and data processing software Standard protocols Assessment of instrument performance System characterization and validation Pre-market end-user testing  U44 Phase I/II Transition  Applicants can submit separate Phase 1 (U43) or Phase II (U44) applications. However, if Phase I and Phase II are submitted together in one application (U44 Fast-Track), then an administrative review will be conducted by NCATS Program staff to decide whether a project will be considered for transition from Phase I to Phase II. Phase II eligible projects must successfully accomplish milestones of Phase 1 as defined in Milestones Plan. Funding for the Phase II application will be contingent upon (1) assessment of the Phase I progress report and determination that the Phase I goals and milestones were achieved; (2) an update (as necessary) of the Commercialization Plan; (3) determination of the project's potential for meeting the mission of the awarding component and for commercial success; (4) review and approval of other documents necessary for continuation; and (5) availability of funds. The continuation application package is due 2 months prior to the anticipated start date of Phase II.  Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO  Applications not proposing to develop automation and miniaturization of MPS and focused solely on development of healthy and diseased MPS are not responsive to this NOFO. Applications proposing such studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed or considered for funding.  See Section VIII.

"Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN): Small Molecule Drug Discovery and Development for Disorders of the Nervous System (U44 Clinical Trial Optional)","Recent advances in neuroscience offer unprecedented opportunities to discover new treatments for nervous system disorders. However, before a new chemical entity can be tested in a clinical setting, it must undergo a process of chemical optimization to improve potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties, followed by pre-clinical safety testing to meet the standards set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical testing. All of the necessary expertise and resources are not commonly available to small companies as these activities are largely the domain of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and contract research organizations (CROs).    To facilitate drug discovery and development by the neuroscience community, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research (https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/) established the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN), which offers neuroscience researchers funding for drug discovery and development activities that can be conducted in their own laboratories. Researchers have the opportunity to collaborate with NIH-funded consultants and CROs that specialize in medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations development, chemical synthesis under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and Phase I clinical testing. A current list of BPN contractors and consultants is available at https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/bpn_resources.htm. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites applications for new BPN projects.    The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools. A PI with- for example medicinal chemistry expertise and resources may additionally request funding to conduct structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies in their own lab but collaborate with BPN contractors on in vitro ADMET, in vivo PK, drug manufacturing and IND-enabling toxicology studies. By contrast, a PI with limited experience in drug discovery and development may opt to collaborate with all available BPN contractors. Applicants may propose to conduct all drug discovery and development activities themselves or collaborate with BPN contractors on activities of their choice.    For each project funded under this NOFO, the NIH will assemble a customized Lead Development Team (LDT). The LDT will be co-chaired by the PI and a BPN consultant and will include members of the PI's team, additional BPN consultants, and NIH staff. The LDT will establish an overall strategy for the project, including milestones proposals, outline estudies to be conducted by BPN contractors, and coordinate activities across different research sites.    Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the BPN website (http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/faqs.htm) and contact NIH Scientific/Research staff and participating NIH Institutes/Centers (IC) prior to preparing an application to discuss how they may best utilize BPN resources and whether their application fits the mission of a particular NIH IC.    For this NOFO, Phase I clinical testing, studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. U44 Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.    B. Scope  The BPN is dedicated to the discovery and development of small molecule compounds, of a size and structure that can be readily synthesized and chemically modified (if optimization is required). This program is not designed to support development of biologics or biotechnology products, including oligonucleotides and proteins, or devices - see BPN-Biologics NOFO PAR-21-233 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-233.html) and Blueprint MedTech NOFO PAR-21-282 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-282.html). Applicants should contact NIH Scientific/Research staff regarding small peptides (typically less than 6 amino acids) and other complex chemical structures, as well as combination therapies, to determine suitability for optimization and development within the BPN.    To be eligible for this NOFO, a project must focus on a nervous system condition that falls within the mission of one of the participating Institutes or Centers. Please see Section C below for more information on the interests and restrictions of the participating Institutes and Centers and alternative programs to consider.    Projects can enter either at the Discovery (Exploratory, Hit to Lead or Lead Optimization Stage (BPN milestone orientation)) or the Development stage (preclinical candidate chosen no medicinal chemistry optimization required, or the IND enabling Stage). In the Discovery phase the goal is to characterize and optimize promising hit compounds using medicinal chemistry to establish structure activity relationships (SAR) and structure property relationships (SPR) including in vitro and in vivo properties such as metabolism, selectivity, toxicity, etc. As projects enter or advance to the Development stage the goal is to advance a single development candidate through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and phase I clinical testing. Projects can enter the program at the Development stage and progress in a shorter period to IND enabling toxicology studies and phase I clinical testing.    Typical Project Research Objectives by Stage (see also the BPN milestone orientation that shows typical project structure and resources available through BPN contractors to supplement your resources):    Exploratory Stage Goals:    Demonstrating primary and counterscreen assays are robust, reproducible and can support proposed SAR studies  Screening funnel is finalized with plans for all in vitro and in vivo assays in place for timely execution to move project to the clinical phase within the grant period  Target Product Profile refined and approved  Identification of at least one chemical series for future optimization where preliminary SAR and SPR is generated and demonstrates sufficient results to formulate a data driven strategy for multi-parameter optimization, improving physicochemical and ADMET properties in addition to potency  Hit to Lead Stage Goals:    SAR should meet perspective criteria for advancement with sufficient results; data should be compelling to formulate data-driven strategy to combine compound attributes into a single stereo- and enantiomerically-pure compound meeting clinical candidate selection in the Lead Optimization stage  Pharmacokinetics (PK) should support proposed pharmacodynamic (PD) studies achieving reasonable exposures and duration to achieve efficacy at a dose supportive of advancement to Lead Optimization stage  Lead Optimization Stage Goals:    Identify a preclinical candidate to advance to the development phase of the program that demonstrates a reasonable therapeutic index (comparing dose range finding data to PK/PD experiments)  Complete dose range finding study  Patent position established  Production of lead compound in sufficient quantity to enable large animal dose range studies  Predevelopment Stage Goals:    Complete Candidate characterization including dose range finding (DRF) toxicology studies not yet completed in prior stage (large animal DRF typically), compound characterization salt screen/polymorph, tractable and economical synthesis to enable Phase I, in vitro ADMET characterization to support IND (for example FDA's Guidance In Vitro Drug Interaction Studies Cytochrome P450 Enzyme- and Transporter-Mediated Drug Interactions )  Complete any efficacy studies under rigorous requirements to support clinical dose selections  Engage clinician support for TPP and clinical plans  IND Enabling Stage Goals:    Hold any pre-IND meetings as required  Produce materials to enable GLP toxicology studies  Complete all required studies for IND and produce reports suitable for IND filings. This includes GLP repeat dose toxicology studies in two species, safety pharmacology, genotoxicity evaluation, hERG as well as other studies that may be required for a particular target or route of administration  Manufacture GMP drug and demonstrate suitable drug product formulation for use in Phase I trial  Experience with BPN suggests that many otherwise excellent awarded projects often require additional proof of concept data or the generation of tools in order to meet the program's requirements for initiating medicinal chemistry or IND-enabling studies. For this reason, all BPN SBIR projects will begin with the U44 Phase I to conduct feasibility studies required to launch full scale medicinal chemistry (if entering at the Discovery stage) or IND-enabling studies (if entering at the Development stage). During the U44 Phase I award, the NIH will form the LDT, which will identify and oversee the studies necessary to meet the BPN requirements for initiating medicinal chemistry or IND-enabling studies. The LDT will also design plans and go/no-go milestones for all subsequent Discovery and/or Development work. Progression from U44 Phase I to Phase II will be based on administrative review (see Section D., Milestones). A project that completes all U44 Phase I and Phase II Discovery activities and advances into Development will conduct all Development work (including Development feasibility studies) under the U44 Phase II award. After successful completion of the U44 Phase I, a project may proceed either to the U44 Phase II in either hit-to-lead/lead optimization (SAR) (the discovery stage) or to IND-enabling studies (the development stage). A schematic of this project structure is available on the BPN website at: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/bpn_resources.htm    The following sections describe the Discovery and Development stages in more detail, including the program entry criteria, the program requirements for initiating medicinal chemistry and IND-enabling studies, and examples of activities that can be conducted during the U44 Phase I award. Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIH Scientific/Research staff prior to preparing an application to clarify which entry stage is most appropriate for their project and what to include in their plans for the U44 Phase I award.    Discovery    Projects that require medicinal chemistry to improve the potency and/or drug-like properties of promising bioactive compounds will enter the BPN at the Discovery stage. The process of understanding the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for desired drug properties typically requires dozens of rounds of compound synthesis and testing. Initially, medicinal chemistry will focus heavily on optimizing activity and potency of compounds in primary and secondary in vitro assays. Therefore, it is required to demonstrate robust SAR driving assays and tractable synthetic routes during the UG3 phase including blinded test-retest reliability and sufficient throughput with the primary and secondary screening assays (other standard reliability metrics are listed in the first year BPN milestones). Subsequently, SAR will increase emphasis on ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties of the compounds, with continued monitoring and optimization of bioactivity. The ultimate goal of the SAR effort is the selection of a single development candidate with sufficient bioactivity, therapeutic index, and drug-like properties to proceed to IND-directed pre-clinical safety assessment with reasonable projected human doses.    Entry Criteria for Discovery Stage    Projects must meet the following requirements prior to entering Discovery:    Rigorous data supporting the hypothesis that modulating the putative drug target/affected pathway will produce a desirable outcome for the intended disease indication (it is not necessary to know the precise drug target or mechanism of action). These data may be supporting literature; evidence of the translational relevance from human studies is also encouraged. It is not required nor is it expected that a project entering at the exploratory stage of discovery (BPN milestones) will have in vivo data with the proposed hit compounds. The preparatory phase (U44 Phase I) should be used to characterize the hits in order to develop appropriate tool compounds for in vivo testing in the Hit to Lead stage where in vivo efficacy may be a milestone if in vivo testing is proposed.  A bioactive compound, in hand, that will serve as a starting point for optimization with:  Proof of identity and purity (typically >95%, as determined by, e.g., NMR, melting point, or LC/MS, with no single impurity > 0.5%)  In vitro biological activity (typically < 1 M in biochemical assays and <10 M in cell-based assays relevant to the drug target), confirmed by repeat dose-response testing, with more than one batch of compound  Information on selectivity for the intended target over closely related targets, if desired (and when the target is known)  Primary and secondary in vitro bioactivity assays that can be used for driving SAR studies (may require further optimization for throughput during Preparatory stage)  Selectivity and counter-screening assays to address potential activity at related targets and other undesirable activities or artifacts (may require further optimization for throughput during Preparatory stage)  In vivo efficacy is not required at the entry to discovery stage. Availability of preclinical animal model(s) that can be used to assess in vivo efficacy and/or target engagement (measurement of target binding or proximal downstream effects) in the hit to lead or lead optimization stages should be available for the Hit to Lead stage where in vivo efficacy testing is included as a required milestone if animal model testing is proposed.  No obvious legal (e.g., intellectual property) constraints to pursuing the proposed chemical scaffold(s) and using the proposed assays and models for research purposes and/or commercial development  Preparatory Activities for Discovery Stage Projects (U44 Phase I)    All Discovery projects will begin with a U44 Phase I award of up to two years. The first 6-12 months should be used to prepare for SAR studies. The following are general expectations for a BPN project to initiate SAR studies:    Completion of an in vitro ADME and physicochemical profile for the starting compound that includes measures of aqueous solubility, microsome stability, CYP inhibition, and permeability (e.g., MDCK or Caco-2)  Demonstration that the primary assay meets the following validation criteria to reliably rank compounds with similar activities:  A statistical demonstration of reliability, e.g., a Z-factor (Z') =0.5 and a coefficient of variation (CV) =20%  Concentration response testing over at least 10 concentrations generates reproducible EC50 values within a 3-fold range for at least 4 compounds  Blinded test-retest reliability with R?2 of at least 0.75 on at least 8 compounds exhibiting EC50 values across a 100-fold range of potency  Throughput of at least 10 compounds per week, run with sufficient replicates to produce robust and reproducible 10-point dose-response curves  Demonstration that the proposed secondary bioactivity assays and counter-screening and selectivity assays have sufficient reliability and throughput for their proposed use in the project  Demonstration of a clear correlation between activity in the primary assay and activity in confirmatory assays and models, sufficient to justify advancement criteria in a testing funnel  Examples of activities that can be supported during the Discovery (U44 Phase I) preparatory phase include:    Establishment of a project milestone plan, including milestones that must be met to initiate SAR studies and desired compound profiles (including prospective criteria) at completion of lead optimization  Refinement of a compound testing funnel, including studies to correlate activity across different bioactivity assays to justify advancement criteria  In vivo pharmacology and, if applicable, studies using established biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement  Studies to develop or validate target engagement markers that will be used in critical-path experiments  Optimization and validation of bioactivity, selectivity, and counter-screening assays  Critical-path pharmacology studies to clarify the compound mechanism of action (e.g., agonist vs. positive allosteric modulator)  ADMET profiling of starting compound(s) to identify liabilities to address through medicinal chemistry  Limited exploratory medicinal chemistry (approximately 1-2 medicinal chemists for 8-10 months) to enable demonstration/confirmation of synthetic route, establishment of initial structure property relationships (SPR) for metabolism, selectivity and toxicity and bioactivity of proposed hit compounds  Procurement of commercially available analogs (""SAR by catalog"")  The PI(s) will be responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools. Applicants may propose to use BPN contractors for chemical synthesis and ADMET profiling or request funds to conduct this work themselves.    U44 Phase II Activities for Discovery Phase Projects    The BPN typically supports a maximum of 3 years medicinal chemistry effort including 1 year exploratory, 1 year Hit to Lead and 1 year Lead Optimization. Therefore, projects can request a maximum of years support of medicinal chemistry in Phase II however it is expected that projects completing Hit to Lead in Phase I should request up to one additional year of medicinal chemistry in Phase II to complete the SAR studies to identify a development candidate that meets the entry criteria for Development (below). By the end of the Hit to Lead year, the PI is expected to demonstrate in vivo activity for a representative compound from the lead series, delivered by any route of administration if in vivo testing is proposed.    The Discovery U44 Phase II award typically supports the following activities:    Design and synthesis of analogs for SAR studies  Compound scale up for in vivo testing, dose ranging finding toxicity (DRF) evaluation  Testing of analogs in bioactivity assays and animal models  Testing of analogs in selectivity and counter-screening assays  Testing of analogs in ADMET assays (e.g., microsome stability, CYP induction and inhibition, solubility, permeability in MDCK or Caco-2 cells, plasma protein binding, brain/plasma ratio, pharmacokinetics [PK] in multiple species)  The PI will be responsible for conducting primary in vitro biological assessment of compounds on a one-to-two week schedule to inform the design of subsequent iterations of compound synthesis. In addition to a regular testing schedule in the primary assay, the PI will provide confirmation of the activity of select compounds in secondary and counter-screening assays and animal models relevant to the drug target and therapeutic indication.    BPN contractors can produce compound analogs for SAR testing, scale up compounds as needed for in vivo testing, and provide standard screening services to assess in vitro and in vivo ADMET characteristics of the compounds. Typically, BPN will assign up to four medicinal chemist FTEs to a project, generating approximately 4-8 compounds per week, plus additional staff to support computational chemistry modeling and ADMET studies as appropriate.    Compounds that meet the BPN's criteria for a development candidate can continue seamlessly on into Development.    Development    The Development stage includes IND-directed preclinical safety studies, GMP synthesis of clinical trial material, formulation development, and phase I clinical testing. Projects that have completed medicinal chemistry optimization and identified a development candidate may initiate Development activities within BPN. The BPN does not support SAR studies during Development.    Entry Criteria for Development Stage    Application for entry into the Development stage must have identified the candidate compound and cannot request additional medicinal chemistry resources. It may be acceptable to have 2 candidates that will be narrowed to a single candidate as part of the U44 Phase I activities (time and budget permitting).    Projects must meet the following requirements prior to entering the Development Stage:    A strong package of data linking the putative drug target/affected pathway to the proposed disease indication and supporting the hypothesis that altering the target activity as proposed will produce desirable outcomes for the disease.  Proposed compound must have in vitro and in vivo biological activity and ADMET properties appropriate for the intended clinical use (i.e., the disease indication, patient population, delivery mode, treatment duration, and treatment regimen) and outcomes.  Applicants should show that their proposed compounds are efficacious when delivered by the clinically intended route of administration, at exposure levels that can likely be achieved clinically with the proposed human dosing regimen.  Proposed compounds should give defensible results in tests for Ames mutagenicity, hERG activity, microsome stability, CYP inhibition, plasma protein binding, and aqueous solubility.  In cases where the molecular target of compound action is known, the applicant should demonstrate the degree of selectivity for the intended target over closely related targets.  Counter-screening to determine selectivity across a broad panel of unrelated pharmacological targets (e.g., G protein-coupled receptors, kinases, etc.) is also required.  Demonstration that the ability of the PI's institution to develop and commercialize the proposed compound for the proposed indication is unlikely to be blocked or impeded by legal (e.g., intellectual property) constraints and that there is support from the institution to file and maintain the patents estate and necessary regulatory documents along with associated cost.  Preparatory Activities for Development Stage Projects (U44 Phase I)    All applications proposing to enter at the Development stage will begin with a U44 Phase I award of up to two years, to prepare for IND-enabling studies, which will be supported under the U44 Phase II award. Projects that entered at the Discovery stage will conduct these activities during their U44 Phase II award. The following are general expectations for a project to initiate IND-enabling studies within BPN:    Dose-range finding (DRF) toxicology studies (rodent and non-rodent) show an acceptable safety margin (e.g., 5x if toxicity can be monitored, reversible, and has premonitory signs; 10x if toxicity is more severe but controllable/reversible; 30x if toxicity is unlikely to be easily monitored, controllable, reversible, or have premonitory signs). Formulation to enable exposure margins suitable for these toxicology studies may need to be explored.  Viable synthetic route for manufacturing (acceptable cost, number of steps and purification techniques needed) to enable GLP toxicology studies and Phase I testing  Viable API (active pharmaceutical ingredient; salt and polymorph selection complete, acceptable stability to support initial clinical trial)  Examples of activities that can be supported during the Development preparatory activities include:    Establishment of a preclinical development plan, including milestones for advancement into IND-enabling studies and the desired profile for a development candidate  Design and planning for the Phase I clinical trials (if applicable)  Validation of ADMET data  Replication/confirmation of key in vivo pharmacology data  Scale-up synthesis for toxicology studies and formulation (including required material amounts for DRF studies if not available at time of award)  Salt and polymorph screening  Compound stability studies  Pre-formulation/formulation work to enable toxicology studies  Multiple-dose rodent PK testing, with pharmacodynamic (PD) correlations if applicable  Dose-range finding toxicology studies  Metabolite identification  The PD(s)/PI(s) is responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools. BPN contractors can perform all other work.    U44 Phase II Activities for Development Stage Projects    The Development U44 Phase II award may include the following:    Manufacturing of material for toxicology studies (DRF & GLP) and/or GMP manufacturing of material for phase I clinical testing  IND-enabling toxicology studies  IND document preparation  Phase I clinical trial (a single and/or multiple ascending dose study to characterize safety, PK, and PD)  The PI's Institution will be responsible for assembly and submission of the IND application and scheduling meetings with the FDA and therefore should include support for this activity in their plan. NIH staff and consultants on the LDT must be included in all meetings with the FDA.    The development of the protocol and management of the phase I clinical trial will be performed by a Clinical Development Team (CDT), which will evolve from the LDT and include the PI, clinical consultants identified by the PI and NIH, and NIH staff. The protocol, selected supporting trial documents, and regulatory documents will be submitted to NIH for administrative review (including internal and external experts) prior to commencement of the clinical trial (defined as signing of first informed consent).    BPN contractors can conduct the preclinical safety studies, GMP synthesis, formulation and other activities required to prepare for human testing. BPN contractors will provide data and reports in a format suitable for inclusion in an IND application and will assist in the development of the application. The phase I clinical trial can also be conducted through BPN contractors.    Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO:    Non-responsive applications will not be reviewed.    The following activities are considered non-responsive to this NOFO:    Screening to identify hit compounds  Basic research and studies of disease mechanism  Animal model development  Development of risk, detection, diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and prevention biomarkers as well as PET ligands  Development of diagnostics and diagnostic devices  Development of biologics and biotechnology products  Studies directed beyond Phase I clinical testing  C. NIH Institute and Center Interests and Guidance  National Institute on Aging (NIA)    NIA is interested in studies that will provide drug development expertise and infrastructure support to researchers interested in developing novel small molecules aimed at modifying the behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), delaying the onset or slowing the progression of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), other dementias of aging and age-related cognitive decline. Ideally, this initiative is aimed at researchers who have promising small molecule compounds but lack the necessary outside expertise and infrastructure to advance these compounds to the clinic.    Researchers who may have the necessary drug development expertise and access to infrastructure to advance small molecules to the clinic should consider submitting an application to the Alzheimer's Drug Development Program (PAR 22-047) or its reissue. This program is also available to researchers who are interested in the preclinical development of small molecules and biologics.    National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)    Alcohol interacts directly and indirectly with a wide spectrum of molecular targets in the brain, and alcohol-seeking behaviors and alcohol use disorders (AUD) involve multiple neurotransmitter systems, neuromodulators, hormones, signal transduction pathways, etc. These include signaling systems and signal transduction pathways of opioids, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA), endocannabinoids, neuropeptides (e.g. corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), neuropeptide Y, substance P), and protein kinases A and C. Numerous therapeutic agents targeting these and other molecular systems have been studied preclinically and in clinical trials. NIAAA is interested in research aimed to develop new pharmaceuticals to provide effective therapy for AUD. Studies involving novel targets previously un-recognized or understudied for the treatment of AUD are particularly encouraged. Specific genetic variants that may contribute to the risk for alcoholism and/or render alcohol dependent individuals responsive to specific therapeutic agent have been discovered. NIAAA is interested in supporting research to develop pharmaceuticals targeting individuals with identified genotypic and phenotypic characteristics to improve efficacy and safety.    National Eye Institute (NEI)    The National Eye Institute (NEI) interest in Blueprint Neurotherapeutics is to develop novel therapies to treat diseases and disorders of the visual system, especially blinding eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, ocular pain and other conditions. The NEI is also interested in other visual system disorders such as strabismus and amblyopia that could be treated with pharmacological interventions. Each project should have a well-defined endpoint, achievable within a five-year time frame, for developing a treatment for a specific disease or disorder of the visual system. The steps towards this goal should be clearly delineated in a series of milestones that support the development of a novel therapeutic that can then be tested in a clinical trial. If successful, a project funded under this program may lead to filing an IND-directed pharmacological and toxicological study, and Phase I clinical testing. Investigators are encouraged to contact NEI program staff to discuss potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with priorities of the Institute.    National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)    NIDCR is interested in neurotherapeutics development for painful disorders of the orofacial region including but not limited to temporomandibular joint disorder, trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, oral cancer pain and other conditions. Recent advances in genomics and phenotyping of subjects with orofacial pain conditions have expanded the scope of potential targets to treat these conditions. Receptor systems, ion channels, and pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules have been implicated in chronic pain. NIDCR is interested in supporting research that will lead to highly efficacious and specific pharmacological treatments for individuals with orofacial pain disorders.    Investigators are encouraged to contact NIDCR program staff to discuss potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with priorities of the Institute mission and strategic plan.    Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)    The NICHD is interested in supporting neurotherapeutic research aimed to discover small molecules and compounds, and develop novel and improved pharmacotherapies for developmental disorders, diseases and conditions in pediatric population, including but not limited to:    Genomic neurodegenerative diseases that manifest in infancy or childhood;  Intellectual and developmental disabilities;  Traumatic injuries, including spinal cord injury, brain injury, and stroke, and the treatment of the chronic consequences of these conditions in pediatric populations;  Management of acute pain in critically ill pediatric patients.  Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact NICHD program staff to discuss their potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the...",PAR-24-063,"Phase II",SBIR,HHS,NIH,"August 19, 2026","November 1, 2023","January 9, 2024",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-24-063.html,Open,2024,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/10772
"NINDS Exploratory Clinical Trials for Small Business (R43/R44 Clinical Trial Required)","Purpose  NINDS is committed to advancing diagnostics and treatments for people burdened by neurological diseases, and the NINDS Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs have provided the small business community with critical seed funding to support the development of a wide variety of technologies and therapeutics for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.  The development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the “Valley of Death”). In particular, the development of regulated products such as therapeutics and medical devices often requires several years and substantial capital investments, due in part to the high costs of clinical trials.  This NOFO supports applications from Small Business Concerns (SBCs) for exploratory clinical trials that contribute to the justification for a future trial to establish definitive efficacy (such as a Phase 3 clinical trial or a Pivotal device trial). This includes Phase 1 and 2 studies of drugs and biologics, feasibility and preliminary efficacy studies of devices, as well as early studies of surgical, behavioral or rehabilitation therapies. This NOFO supports single-site and multi-site trials with up to three clinical sites. Applications must aim to generate data that inform further clinical development of the proposed intervention or diagnostic, and in the case of FDA-regulated clinical trials applications must demonstrate readiness by including FDA approval of the proposed study. The earliest clinical studies should be designed to provide important initial information regarding the intervention (e.g., safety, tolerability, dosing) or diagnostic. Midstage clinical studies will generally include randomization and blinding and should yield data that allow a clear go/no-go decision regarding whether the intervention should proceed to an efficacy trial. All applications must outline specific plans for future development in the event of promising results.  This NOFO is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy. Applications to implement definitive efficacy trials (e.g., Phase 3 clinical trials of drugs or Pivotal device trials) should be submitted to NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials (UG3/UH3). See https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-237.html for more information.  This NOFO is not intended to support the conduct of clinical trials with more than three clinical sites. NINDS supports several clinical trial networks specifically designed to implement larger multi-site clinical trials. See https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Clinical-Research for more information.  Renewal applications of SBIR Phase II awards (i.e., SBIR Phase IIB) to conduct Phase I and II clinical studies should be submitted to NINDS Renewal Awards of SBIR Phase II Grants (Phase IIB) for Clinical Trials and Clinical Research (R44).  The goal of this NOFO is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product/technology that requires Federal regulatory approval or to bring a complex research tool to market. To achieve this goal, the NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of clinical-stage projects to the commercialization stage by encouraging business relationships between NIH’s SBIR/STTR recipients and third-party investors and/or strategic partners.  Definitions  For this funding opportunity announcement Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. SBIR Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.  NIH defines a clinical trial as ""a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.""  Specific Objectives  Scientific/Technical Scope  Examples of appropriate studies under this NOFO include, but are not limited to, those designed to:  Evaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in healthy volunteers or the target population. Evaluate whether an intervention produces sufficient evidence of short-term activity (e.g., biomarker activity, target engagement, dose-response trends, pharmacodynamic response) in a human ""proof of concept"" trial. Select or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy (e.g., futility trials). For devices: Establish proof-of-principle and optimize techniques, operation, and usability of a device; inform the final device design decisions; and estimate the magnitude of treatment effect. NINDS recognizes that devices can differ greatly in terms of basic form and function, physiological bases for therapy, degree of invasiveness, etc. A Pivotal device study, for example, could potentially be used in support of an off-label indication of an existing market approved device, or to provide evidence for a novel device design in support of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), 510(k) or 510(k) De Novo submission. Due to the broad scope of possible medical devices and the varied nature of the regulatory path, investigators considering applications to evaluate devices are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific/Research Staff as early as possible to discuss these issues and determine the suitability of their project for this funding mechanism.  Every facet of the United States scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation–requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. NIH’s ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further NIH's mission. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.  See the Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031. Moreover, fostering diversity by encouraging the participation of individuals from nationally underrepresented groups in the scientific research workforce is a longstanding interest of Congress, (e.g., Public Law 117–167, CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, P.L. 114-329, American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017, P.L. 114-255, 21st Century Cures Act of 2016). Also, fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses in technological innovation is one of the goals of the SBIR and STTR programs (https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_May2023.pdf).  Independent Third-Party Partners  As significant funding is often needed to take regulated clinical projects to market beyond initial clinical studies, we encourage applicants to develop business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide substantial financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products and technologies initiated with NIH SBIR or STTR funding. Third-party partners include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an “angel” investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a state or local government, or any combination of the above. In light of these goals, the NINDS strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in the commercialization of emerging biomedical technologies.  That said, NINDS recognizes that companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or that target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive to investors and strategic partners at preclinical or early clinical stages of development. Many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically dispersed patient populations.  For the purposes of this NOFO, NINDS has defined small markets as development of novel products that:  Address a rare disease, defined in the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-280) as a condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States; or Qualify as a Humanitarian Use Device, defined as a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 persons in the United States per year; or Target a young pediatric population defined as including neonates (0-28 days), infants (<2 years), and/or children (2-12 years of age), as indicated in the FDA Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices; or Are complex research tools. This is instrumentation comprising several distinct parts that must work together. Very often the goal of such projects is to deliver turnkey products for researchers. For example, high density electroencephalography instrumentation includes electrode arrays, amplifiers, data analytic and data visualization software, etc. Another example is non-invasive near infrared imaging instrumentation, which might include photon sources and detectors, timing devices for delivering photons, amplifiers, and software. Some high throughput assay systems may fall into this category. NINDS, as part of NIH, strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, NINDS explicitly emphasizes the NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm) and provides additional guidance to the scientific community (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/grant_policy). For example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on a robust and rigorous scientific rationale, which means that data supporting the scientific rationale should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.  The proposed clinical trial must be based on a robust and rigorous scientific rationale (e.g., derived from non-clinical in vivo and/or in vitro studies or preliminary clinical studies) that demonstrates that there is an adequate scientific foundation to justify the proposed trial. The proposed trial design must also use rigorous and transparent approaches.  Applicants should take note of the following:  (1) Consultation with NINDS: Applicants are encouraged to consult with NINDS Scientific/Research staff as plans for an application are being developed (see Section VII, Agency Contacts) and no later than 12 weeks prior to the anticipated application submission date. This early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify NINDS policies and guidelines as well as to discuss how to develop an appropriate project timeline and milestone plan, which is subject to peer review. As well, discussions regarding strategies for recruitment and inclusion of women and minorities as participants in research involving human subjects are available.  (2) Other Relevant Programs: NINDS supports several clinical trial networks specifically designed to implement multi-site clinical trials. See https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Clinical-Research for more information:  NeuroNEXT (http://www.neuronext.org): NINDS has a network called NeuroNEXT specifically designed to implement multicenter exploratory clinical trials (see https://www.neuronext.org/) and when appropriate, it is strongly preferred that such trials be performed within this network. Therefore, applying to this exploratory clinical trials NOFO, an applicant should follow the instructions on the above website to obtain feedback on the suitability of their trial for NeuroNEXT. An important advantage of NeuroNEXT is that it can provide clinical, statistical and logistical expertise in developing study protocols as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.  StrokeNet (http://www.nihstrokenet.org): NINDS has a network called StrokeNet specifically designed to implement multicenter exploratory and efficacy trials in stroke prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (see http://www.nihstrokenet.org/). NINDS requires that all large stroke trials be considered for StrokeNet. Only under exceptional circumstances will NINDS consider funding such trials outside of the StrokeNet program (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-14-043.html). An important advantage of StrokeNet is that it can provide clinical, statistical and logistical expertise in developing study protocols as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.  EPPIC-Net (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC ): The Early Phase Pain Investigation Clinical Network (EPPIC-Net) seeks to enhance the treatment of acute and chronic pain and reduce reliance on opioids by accelerating early-phase clinical trials of non-addictive treatments for pain. EPPIC-Net has the capacity to quickly and efficiently conduct many simultaneous multisite studies. The network will conduct studies on a variety of treatments, including drugs and devices, as well as studies to better understand pain. Successful asset applicants do not receive funding but rather receive access to EPPIC-Net resources for conduct of the clinical trial for their asset. Intellectual property and products studied within EPPIC-Net remain the property of the asset owner.  SIREN (https://siren.network/): NINDS supports the SIREN network which performs clinical trials that impact the care of the patient with a neurological emergency other than stroke in the pre-hospital or emergency department setting. NINDS requires that all such trials be first considered for the SIREN network, though the study PI may come from outside of the network. The study PI will work with the SIREN network to write the protocol and lead the operations committee for the trial.  Before submitting an application to this NOFO, applicants should consult with NINDS scientific/research staff to obtain feedback on the suitability of their trial for one of these networks. An important advantage of the networks is their capacity to provide clinical, statistical, and logistical expertise in developing study protocols, as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.  Trans-NIH Initiatives. NINDS participates in funding opportunities under the NIH HEAL Initiative® that support clinical trials focused on development of therapies and technologies directed at enhanced pain management. If eligible, companies are encouraged to apply through these funding opportunities. For more information visit: https://heal.nih.gov/.  NINDS Cooperative Agreement (U44) Translational Programs. NINDS has specific translational programs that utilize the SBIR cooperative agreement mechanism (U44), some of which allow preclinical and clinical trial activity within a single proposal. If eligible, companies are encouraged to apply through these programs. For more information visit: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Translational-Research.  (3) NIH Resources: As appropriate, applicants are encouraged to make use of the following resources for clinical research including:  Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa); NeuroQOL (http://www.neuroqol.org); NIH Toolbox (http://www.nihtoolbox.org); PROMIS (http://www.nihpromis.org); and NINDS Common Data Elements (http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov). Applicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing NINDS research resources for their studies whenever possible. Such resources may include biospecimens from NINDS Human Biospecimen and Data Repository (BioSEND) or informatics system. The NINDS BioSEND repository receives, processes, stores, and distributes biospecimen resources from NINDS funded studies that can be shared by the neuroscience research community, and currently banks a variety of biospecimens including DNA, plasma, serum, RNA, CSF, and saliva. The NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository provides 1) disease-relevant stem cell lines for biomarker discovery, and/or 2) the capacity to bank blood for the creation of new cell lines relevant to their disease of interest. Leveraging the resources and support from neurological disorder advocacy groups, private research foundations, academic institutions, other government agencies and the NIH Intramural program are also encouraged. Finally, applicants are encouraged to leverage the resources of ongoing clinical trials supported through other Federal or private funds.  Applications proposing to collect biospecimens are strongly recommended to use the BioSEND protocols and procedures, and all specimens collected and banked with BioSEND must come from individuals who have consented to banking and sharing broadly with academia and industry. Note that costs for collection are NOT included as a component of the NINDS Biomarkers Repository award. Therefore, most costs for the biospecimen banking are borne by the recipients  utilizing this resource (see NOT-NS-15-046). Applicants planning projects in which biospecimens will be collected are strongly advised to consult the BioSEND website for more information about samples banked at the repository. In addition, applicants are advised to consult with BioSEND staff to obtain a quote for biospecimen banking costs (email: biosend@iu.edu).  (4) IRB documentation: IRB approval is not required at the time of application submission, but is required prior to funding. As such, NINDS encourages investigators to begin these processes as early as possible. NINDS also will require documentation of any other necessary regulatory approvals (e.g., Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee) prior to funding. Applicants are encouraged to review the NIH policy concerning single IRB for multisite clinical trials (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html and https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-076.html) as well as the sIRB requirement per the revised Common Rule at 45CFR46.114 https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/revised-common-rule-regulatory-text/index.html#46.114.  (5) Study Rationale: The rationale for a clinical trial must be based on (i) an unmet medical need; (ii) a plausible biological mechanism; and (iii) robust supporting data, e.g., from non-clinical (in vivo and/or in vitro data) studies or preliminary clinical studies that demonstrate there is an adequate scientific foundation to justify the proposed trial. The scientific premise for the trial should be based on preclinical and/or clinical data from rigorously performed studies (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-103.html). If previous research does not meet the rigor criteria outlined to an acceptable degree, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies.  (6) Efficacy: This NOFO is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy (although under certain circumstances, early studies of preliminary efficacy can be a secondary aim). While an exploratory clinical trial may examine clinical outcomes or biomarker outcomes as measures of ""preliminary efficacy"" as a secondary aim, it is important that it not appear to be an underpowered efficacy trial. Applications to implement definitive efficacy trials (e.g., Phase 3 trials of drugs or Pivotal device trials) should be submitted to PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. While an exploratory clinical trial may examine clinical outcomes or biomarker outcomes as measures of ""preliminary efficacy"" as a secondary aim, it is important that it not appear to be an underpowered efficacy trial.  (7) Effect Size: A drug or biologic trial will not be considered for funding under this NOFO when its primary objective is to estimate intervention effect size to be used in power calculations for a future efficacy clinical trial. Effect size estimates based on small or short-term studies are often unreliable. Power for an efficacy trial should be based on the smallest clinically meaningful effect size, which is often determined by surveying physicians or patients, or by comparison to the effect produced by existing interventions.  (8) Ancillary studies: Ancillary studies, defined as research undertaken to address scientific questions relevant to the parent study and that require access to data or records from the parent study, and/or involve collection of additional data, specimens, or records, are not permitted within the clinical trial application. Applicants are advised to discuss their ideas with Scientific/Research staff for direction on an appropriate funding mechanism.  (9) Secondary Aims: For drugs and biologics, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures may be addressed as secondary aims in a clinical trial, but not as the primary aim. Examples of such secondary aims include  Determining the optimal measure (endpoint), its variability, and/or the optimal timing of outcome evaluations in the context of the intervention Collecting information on the utility of questionnaires, rating scales, or biomarkers Developing and refining data collection procedures. Optimizing the administration of the study intervention. Developing and refining standardized methods of assessing outcome. Optimizing methods for identifying, recruiting, and retaining study participants. For Early Feasibility or Traditional Feasibility studies of medical devices, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures are expected to be addressed as primary aims in addition to providing initial clinical safety data at this stage. These may include:  Identifying appropriate modifications to the procedure or device to enable a subsequent Pivotal study on a finalized system; Refining the intended use population; Developing and refining data collection procedures; Refining the non-clinical test plans or methodologies; and Developing subsequent clinical study protocols. (10) Multiple Trials: There may be several questions to be answered before a phase 3 efficacy trial can be designed and conducted. The proposed study is not required to address all potential questions, but the applicant should clearly detail the overall clinical development plan for the intervention, which could involve more than one exploratory trial.  (11) Innovative Designs: The use of innovative and efficient study designs is encouraged, such as adaptive dose-finding designs, designs incorporating plans for sample size recalculation, preliminary efficacy for devices, and futility designs. Applications for Phase 1 trials in the patient population are encouraged when appropriate (e.g., certain rare diseases), as are applications that encompass Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (early proof of mechanism or proof of concept). Applications Phase 3 trials should be submitted under PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. For medical devices, Traditional Feasibility study designs may include, for example, single-arm studies, on-off interventions (patients as their own controls), device-device comparisons, device-drug comparisons, comparisons to historical controls, comparisons to performance criteria/goals, adaptive designs, and Bayesian designs.  (12) Pharmacometrics: Applications seeking to obtain data needed for pharmacometric modeling are encouraged, with the aim of enabling the optimal design of a future efficacy trial of an intervention.  (13) Innovative Technologies: Applicants are encouraged to consider utilizing (at least experimentally) digital/mobile/sensor technologies and web-based systems to facilitate data collection (including data collection in a continual, contextual, real-world setting rather than through a traditional milestone-based approach), as well as to enhance protocol adherence.  (14) Rare Diseases: Trials in rare diseases are encouraged, particularly in conditions for which definitive outcome measures and prior data from natural history studies are available. It is recognized that available patient pools may not be adequate to meet the sample size requirements typically seen in trials in more common disorders of the nervous system, and innovative trial designs, including crossover designs and adaptive designs, can be appropriately considered. Additionally, an assessment of clinical efficacy as a secondary outcome may be warranted for rare diseases where the available patient pool may not make a definitive efficacy trial feasible. Regardless of the design it is especially important to ensure that the study design and statistical analysis plans will meet the stated objectives, and allow for the most efficient evaluation of the limited subjects. The application should clearly demonstrate recruitment feasibility at the participating site and applicants are encouraged to fully engage patient advocacy groups or similar representatives of the affected disease community in study design, execution, and reporting.  (15) Relationships with Patient Groups: Applicants are strongly encouraged to establish relationships with patient groups and solicit their input on recruitment, the clinical meaningfulness of the question under study, the relevance of the proposed clinical outcomes, and approaches to minimizing the burden on study subjects  (16) Biomarkers: Applications are encouraged that evaluate preliminary efficacy based on early signals of activity on biomarkers or clinical endpoints, or that mechanistically test the activity of an intervention in terms of its presumed target(s). However, this NOFO is not appropriate for applications primarily intended to discover biomarkers.  Applications Not-Responsive to this NOFO:  Non-responsive applications will not be reviewed.  Applications primarily intended to discover biomarkers. For Biomarker funding opportunities at NINDS please visit: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Tools-Topics/Biomarkers. Applications for Phase 3 trials. These projects should be submitted under PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. Applications for a clinical trial where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy. Applications to implement definitive efficacy trials (e.g., Phase 3 trials of drugs or Pivotal device trials) should be submitted to PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. Trials where the primary objective is to estimate intervention effect size to be used in power calculations for a future efficacy clinical trial. Multi-site clinical trials with more than three clinical sites. These trials may be supported through NINDS clinical trial networks, such as StrokeNet (http://www.nihstrokenet.org), NeuroNEXT (http://www.neuronext.org) and EPPIC-Net (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC). Preclinical activities to support filing of an IND or IDE followed by clinical trial activities supported by this IND/IDE. Studies requiring an IND/IDE where the applicant has not demonstrated that their intervention falls into one of the following scenarios: (a) The protocol has been submitted under an open IND and the IND is not under full or partial hold. Under this scenario, applicants must provide documentation such as a ""may proceed"" email or letter from the FDA.  (b) The protocol has been submitted as an original IDE or as a new study under an open IDE, and FDA has fully approved the IDE or IDE supplement. Under this scenario, applicants must provide documentation of an IDE or IDE supplement full approval letter from the FDA.  (c) The protocol has been submitted under an IND and is on full or partial hold. Under this scenario applicants must provide full documentation from the FDA on the reasons for hold and the FDA recommendations. Applicants should discuss how they intend to address the hold issues and when they believe they will have FDA approval to proceed with trial implementation.  (d) The protocol has been submitted as an original IDE or as a new study under an open IDE, and FDA has conditionally approved the IDE or IDE supplement. Under this scenario applicants must provide full documentation from the FDA on the conditions of approval. Applicants should discuss how they intend to address these conditions and when they believe they will have FDA approval to proceed with trial implementation.  (e) The protocol is exempt from an IND. Under this scenario applicants must provide a copy of the exemption letter from the FDA.  (f) The protocol is either exempt from the IDE regulations or does not require IDE approval because it is determined to be nonsignificant risk. Under this scenario applicants must provide either an IDE exemption letter or a copy of the risk determination letter from the FDA. For devices, if the IRB has determined that the device is Non-Significant Risk, documentation from the IRB is acceptable.  (g) The study is of a non-regulated intervention, including surgical and behavioral interventions. Provide a Non-Significant Risk documentation of your intervention from an IRB.",PAR-23-311,BOTH,SBIR,HHS,NIH,"September 6, 2026","November 27, 2023","December 5, 2023",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-311.html,Open,2024,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/10776
"NINDS Exploratory Clinical Trials for Small Business (R41/R42 Clinical Trial Required)","Purpose  NINDS is committed to advancing diagnostics and treatments for people burdened by neurological diseases, and the NINDS Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs have provided the small business community with critical seed funding to support the development of a wide variety of technologies and therapeutics for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.  The development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the “Valley of Death”). In particular, the development of regulated products such as therapeutics and medical devices often requires several years and substantial capital investments, due in part to the high costs of clinical trials.  This NOFO supports applications from Small Business Concerns (SBCs) for exploratory clinical trials that contribute to the justification for a future trial to establish definitive efficacy (such as a Phase 3 clinical trial or a Pivotal device trial). This includes Phase 1 and 2 studies of drugs and biologics, feasibility and preliminary efficacy studies of devices, as well as early studies of surgical, behavioral or rehabilitation therapies. This NOFO supports single-site and multi-site trials with up to three clinical sites. Applications must aim to generate data that inform further clinical development of the proposed intervention or diagnostic, and in the case of FDA-regulated clinical trials applications must demonstrate readiness by including FDA approval of the proposed study. The earliest clinical studies should be designed to provide important initial information regarding the intervention (e.g., safety, tolerability, dosing) or diagnostic. Midstage clinical studies will generally include randomization and blinding and should yield data that allow a clear go/no-go decision regarding whether the intervention should proceed to an efficacy trial. All applications must outline specific plans for future development in the event of promising results.  This NOFO is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy. Applications to implement definitive efficacy trials (e.g., Phase 3 clinical trials of drugs or Pivotal device trials) should be submitted to NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials (UG3/UH3 ). See https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-237.html for more information.  This NOFO is not intended to support the conduct of clinical trials with more than three clinical sites. NINDS supports several clinical trial networks specifically designed to implement larger multi-site clinical trials. See https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Clinical-Research for more information.  Renewal applications of SBIR Phase II awards (i.e., SBIR Phase IIB) to conduct Phase I and II clinical studies should be submitted to NINDS Renewal Awards of SBIR Phase II Grants (Phase IIB) for Clinical Trials and Clinical Research (R44).  The goal of this NOFO is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product/technology that requires Federal regulatory approval or to bring a complex research tool to market. To achieve this goal, the NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of clinical-stage projects to the commercialization stage by encouraging business relationships between NIH’s SBIR/STTR recipients  and third-party investors and/or strategic partners.  Definitions  For this funding opportunity announcement Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. SBIR Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.  NIH defines a clinical trial as “a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.”  Specific Objectives  Scientific/Technical Scope  Examples of appropriate studies under this NOFO include, but are not limited to, those designed to:  Evaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in healthy volunteers or the target population. Evaluate whether an intervention produces sufficient evidence of short-term activity (e.g., biomarker activity, target engagement, dose-response trends, pharmacodynamic response) in a human ""proof of concept"" trial. Select or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy (e.g., futility trials). For devices: Establish proof-of-principle and optimize techniques, operation, and usability of a device; inform the final device design decisions; and estimate the magnitude of treatment effect. NINDS recognizes that devices can differ greatly in terms of basic form and function, physiological bases for therapy, degree of invasiveness, etc. A Pivotal device study, for example, could potentially be used in support of an off-label indication of an existing market approved device, or to provide evidence for a novel device design in support of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), 510(k) or 510(k) De Novo submission. Due to the broad scope of possible medical devices and the varied nature of the regulatory path, investigators considering applications to evaluate devices are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific/Research Staff as early as possible to discuss these issues and determine the suitability of their project for this funding mechanism.  Every facet of the United States scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation–requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. NIH’s ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further NIH's mission. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams.  Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.   See the Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031). Fostering diversity by encouraging the participation of individuals from nationally underrepresented groups in the scientific research workforce is a longstanding interest of Congress, (e.g., Public Law 117–167, CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, P.L. 114-329, American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017, P.L. 114-255, 21st Century Cures Act of 2016).

If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.  The proposed clinical trial must be based on a robust and rigorous scientific rationale (e.g., derived from non-clinical in vivo and/or in vitro studies or preliminary clinical studies) that demonstrates that there is an adequate scientific foundation to justify the proposed trial. The proposed trial design must also use rigorous and transparent approaches.  Applicants should take note of the following:  (1) Consultation with NINDS: Applicants are encouraged to consult with NINDS Scientific/Research staff as plans for an application are being developed (see Section VII, Agency Contacts) and no later than 12 weeks prior to the anticipated application submission date. This early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify NINDS policies and guidelines as well as to discuss how to develop an appropriate project timeline and milestone plan, which is subject to peer review. As well, discussions regarding strategies for recruitment and  inclusion of women and minorities as participants in research involving human subjects are available.  (2) Other Relevant Programs: NINDS supports several clinical trial networks specifically designed to implement multi-site clinical trials. See https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Clinical-Research for more information:  NeuroNEXT (http://www.neuronext.org): NINDS has a network called NeuroNEXT specifically designed to implement multicenter exploratory clinical trials (see https://www.neuronext.org/) and when appropriate, it is strongly preferred that such trials be performed within this network. Therefore, applying to this exploratory clinical trials NOFO, an applicant should follow the instructions on the above website to obtain feedback on the suitability of their trial for NeuroNEXT. An important advantage of NeuroNEXT is that it can provide clinical, statistical and logistical expertise in developing study protocols as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.  StrokeNet (http://www.nihstrokenet.org): NINDS has a network called StrokeNet specifically designed to implement multicenter exploratory and efficacy trials in stroke prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (see http://www.nihstrokenet.org/). NINDS requires that all large stroke trials be considered for StrokeNet. Only under exceptional circumstances will NINDS consider funding such trials outside of the StrokeNet program (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-14-043.html). An important advantage of StrokeNet is that it can provide clinical, statistical and logistical expertise in developing study protocols as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.  EPPIC-Net (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC ): The Early Phase Pain Investigation Clinical Network (EPPIC-Net) seeks to enhance the treatment of acute and chronic pain and reduce reliance on opioids by accelerating early-phase clinical trials of non-addictive treatments for pain. EPPIC-Net has the capacity to quickly and efficiently conduct many simultaneous multisite studies. The network will conduct studies on a variety of treatments, including drugs and devices, as well as studies to better understand pain. Successful asset applicants do not receive funding but rather receive access to EPPIC-Net resources for conduct of the clinical trial for their asset. Intellectual property and products studied within EPPIC-Net remain the property of the asset owner.  SIREN (https://siren.network/): NINDS supports the SIREN network which performs clinical trials that impact the care of the patient with a neurological emergency other than stroke in the pre-hospital or emergency department setting. NINDS requires that all such trials be first considered for the SIREN network, though the study PI may come from outside of the network. The study PI will work with the SIREN network to write the protocol and lead the operations committee for the trial.  Before submitting an application to this NOFO, applicants should consult with NINDS scientific/research staff to obtain feedback on the suitability of their trial for one of these networks. An important advantage of the networks is their capacity to provide clinical, statistical, and logistical expertise in developing study protocols, as well as a standing national network of experienced clinical sites prepared to enroll study participants.  Trans-NIH Initiatives. NINDS participates in funding opportunities under the NIH HEAL Initiative® that support clinical trials focused on development of therapies and technologies directed at enhanced pain management. If eligible, companies are encouraged to apply through these funding opportunities. For more information visit: https://heal.nih.gov/.  NINDS Cooperative Agreement (U44) Translational Programs. NINDS has specific translational programs that utilize the SBIR cooperative agreement mechanism (U44), some of which allow preclinical and clinical trial activity within a single proposal. If eligible, companies are encouraged to apply through these programs. For more information visit: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Translational-Research.  (3) NIH Resources: As appropriate, applicants are encouraged to make use of the following resources for clinical research including:  Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa); NeuroQOL (http://www.neuroqol.org); NIH Toolbox (http://www.nihtoolbox.org); PROMIS (http://www.nihpromis.org); and NINDS Common Data Elements (http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov). Applicants are strongly encouraged to leverage existing NINDS research resources for their studies whenever possible. Such resources may include biospecimens from NINDS Human Biospecimen and Data Repository (BioSEND) or informatics system. The NINDS BioSEND repository receives, processes, stores, and distributes biospecimen resources from NINDS funded studies that can be shared by the neuroscience research community, and currently banks a variety of biospecimens including DNA, plasma, serum, RNA, CSF, and saliva. The NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository provides 1) disease-relevant stem cell lines for biomarker discovery, and/or 2) the capacity to bank blood for the creation of new cell lines relevant to their disease of interest. Leveraging the resources and support from neurological disorder advocacy groups, private research foundations, academic institutions, other government agencies and the NIH Intramural program are also encouraged. Finally, applicants are encouraged to leverage the resources of ongoing clinical trials supported through other Federal or private funds.  Applications proposing to collect biospecimens are strongly recommended to use the BioSEND protocols and procedures, and all specimens collected and banked with BioSEND must come from individuals who have consented to banking and sharing broadly with academia and industry. Note that costs for collection are NOT included as a component of the NINDS Biomarkers Repository award. Therefore, most costs for the biospecimen banking are borne by the grantees utilizing this resource (see NOT-NS-15-046). Applicants planning projects in which biospecimens will be collected are strongly advised to consult the BioSEND website for more information about samples banked at the repository. In addition, applicants are advised to consult with BioSEND staff to obtain a quote for biospecimen banking costs (email: biosend@iu.edu).  (4) IRB documentation: IRB approval is not required at the time of application submission, but is required prior to funding. As such, NINDS encourages investigators to begin these processes as early as possible. NINDS also will require documentation of any other necessary regulatory approvals (e.g., Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee) prior to funding. Applicants are encouraged to review the NIH policy concerning single IRB for multisite clinical trials (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html and https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-076.html) as well as the sIRB requirement per the revised Common Rule at 45CFR46.114 https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/revised-common-rule-regulatory-text/index.html#46.114.  (5) Study Rationale: The rationale for a clinical trial must be based on (i) an unmet medical need; (ii) a plausible biological mechanism; and (iii) robust supporting data, e.g., from non-clinical (in vivo and/or in vitro data) studies or preliminary clinical studies that demonstrate there is an adequate scientific foundation to justify the proposed trial. The scientific premise for the trial should be based on preclinical and/or clinical data from rigorously performed studies (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-103.html). If previous research does not meet the rigor criteria outlined to an acceptable degree, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies.  (6) Efficacy: This NOFO is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy (although under certain circumstances, early studies of preliminary efficacy can be a secondary aim). While an exploratory clinical trial may examine clinical outcomes or biomarker outcomes as measures of ""preliminary efficacy"" as a secondary aim, it is important that it not appear to be an underpowered efficacy trial. Applications to implement definitive efficacy trials (e.g., Phase 3 trials of drugs or Pivotal device trials) should be submitted to PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. While an exploratory clinical trial may examine clinical outcomes or biomarker outcomes as measures of ""preliminary efficacy"" as a secondary aim, it is important that it not appear to be an underpowered efficacy trial.  (7) Effect Size: A drug or biologic trial will not be considered for funding under this NOFO when its primary objective is to estimate intervention effect size to be used in power calculations for a future efficacy clinical trial. Effect size estimates based on small or short-term studies are often unreliable. Power for an efficacy trial should be based on the smallest clinically meaningful effect size, which is often determined by surveying physicians or patients, or by comparison to the effect produced by existing interventions.  (8) Ancillary studies: Ancillary studies, defined as research undertaken to address scientific questions relevant to the parent study and that require access to data or records from the parent study, and/or involve collection of additional data, specimens, or records, are not permitted within the clinical trial application. Applicants are advised to discuss their ideas with Scientific/Research staff for direction on an appropriate funding mechanism.  (9) Secondary Aims: For drugs and biologics, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures may be addressed as secondary aims in a clinical trial, but not as the primary aim. Examples of such secondary aims include  Determining the optimal measure (endpoint), its variability, and/or the optimal timing of outcome evaluations in the context of the intervention Collecting information on the utility of questionnaires, rating scales, or biomarkers Developing and refining data collection procedures. Optimizing the administration of the study intervention. Developing and refining standardized methods of assessing outcome. Optimizing methods for identifying, recruiting, and retaining study participants. For Early Feasibility or Traditional Feasibility studies of medical devices, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures are expected to be addressed as primary aims in addition to providing initial clinical safety data at this stage. These may include:  Identifying appropriate modifications to the procedure or device to enable a subsequent Pivotal study on a finalized system; Refining the intended use population; Developing and refining data collection procedures; Refining the non-clinical test plans or methodologies; and Developing subsequent clinical study protocols. (10) Multiple Trials: There may be several questions to be answered before a phase 3 efficacy trial can be designed and conducted. The proposed study is not required to address all potential questions, but the applicant should clearly detail the overall clinical development plan for the intervention, which could involve more than one exploratory trial.  (11) Innovative Designs: The use of innovative and efficient study designs is encouraged, such as adaptive dose-finding designs, designs incorporating plans for sample size recalculation, preliminary efficacy for devices, and futility designs. Applications for Phase 1 trials in the patient population are encouraged when appropriate (e.g., certain rare diseases), as are applications that encompass Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (early proof of mechanism or proof of concept). Applications Phase 3 trials should be submitted under PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. For medical devices, Traditional Feasibility study designs may include, for example, single-arm studies, on-off interventions (patients as their own controls), device-device comparisons, device-drug comparisons, comparisons to historical controls, comparisons to performance criteria/goals, adaptive designs, and Bayesian designs.  (12) Pharmacometrics: Applications seeking to obtain data needed for pharmacometric modeling are encouraged, with the aim of enabling the optimal design of a future efficacy trial of an intervention.  (13) Innovative Technologies: Applicants are encouraged to consider utilizing (at least experimentally) digital/mobile/sensor technologies and web-based systems to facilitate data collection (including data collection in a continual, contextual, real-world setting rather than through a traditional milestone-based approach), as well as to enhance protocol adherence.  (14) Rare Diseases: Trials in rare diseases are encouraged, particularly in conditions for which definitive outcome measures and prior data from natural history studies are available. It is recognized that available patient pools may not be adequate to meet the sample size requirements typically seen in trials in more common disorders of the nervous system, and innovative trial designs, including crossover designs and adaptive designs, can be appropriately considered. Additionally, an assessment of clinical efficacy as a secondary outcome may be warranted for rare diseases where the available patient pool may not make a definitive efficacy trial feasible. Regardless of the design it is especially important to ensure that the study design and statistical analysis plans will meet the stated objectives, and allow for the most efficient evaluation of the limited subjects. The application should clearly demonstrate recruitment feasibility at the participating site and applicants are encouraged to fully engage patient advocacy groups or similar representatives of the affected disease community in study design, execution, and reporting.  (15) Relationships with Patient Groups: Applicants are strongly encouraged to establish relationships with patient groups and solicit their input on recruitment, the clinical meaningfulness of the question under study, the relevance of the proposed clinical outcomes, and approaches to minimizing the burden on study subjects  (16) Biomarkers: Applications are encouraged that evaluate preliminary efficacy based on early signals of activity on biomarkers or clinical endpoints, or that mechanistically test the activity of an intervention in terms of its presumed target(s). However, this NOFO is not appropriate for applications primarily intended to discover biomarkers.  Applications Not-Responsive to this NOFO:  Non-responsive applications will not be reviewed.  Applications primarily intended to discover biomarkers. For Biomarker funding opportunities at NINDS please visit: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Tools-Topics/Biomarkers. Applications for Phase 3 trials. These projects should be submitted under PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. Applications for a clinical trial where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy. Applications to implement definitive efficacy trials (e.g., Phase 3 trials of drugs or Pivotal device trials) should be submitted to PAR-21-237, NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials. Trials where the primary objective is to estimate intervention effect size to be used in power calculations for a future efficacy clinical trial. Multi-site clinical trials with more than three clinical sites. These trials may be supported through NINDS clinical trial networks, such as StrokeNet (http://www.nihstrokenet.org), NeuroNEXT (http://www.neuronext.org) and EPPIC-Net (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC). Preclinical activities to support filing of an IND or IDE followed by clinical trial activities supported by this IND/IDE. Studies requiring an IND/IDE where the applicant has not demonstrated that their intervention falls into one of the following scenarios: (a) The protocol has been submitted under an open IND and the IND is not under full or partial hold. Under this scenario, applicants must provide documentation such as a ""may proceed"" email or letter from the FDA.  (b) The protocol has been submitted as an original IDE or as a new study under an open IDE, and FDA has fully approved the IDE or IDE supplement. Under this scenario, applicants must provide documentation of an IDE or IDE supplement full approval letter from the FDA.  (c) The protocol has been submitted under an IND and is on full or partial hold. Under this scenario applicants must provide full documentation from the FDA on the reasons for hold and the FDA recommendations. Applicants should discuss how they intend to address the hold issues and when they believe they will have FDA approval to proceed with trial implementation.  (d) The protocol has been submitted as an original IDE or as a new study under an open IDE, and FDA has conditionally approved the IDE or IDE supplement. Under this scenario applicants must provide full documentation from the FDA on the conditions of approval. Applicants should discuss how they intend to address these conditions and when they believe they will have FDA approval to proceed with trial implementation.  (e) The protocol is exempt from an IND. Under this scenario applicants must provide a copy of the exemption letter from the FDA.  (f) The protocol is either exempt from the IDE regulations or does not require IDE approval because it is determined to be nonsignificant risk. Under this scenario applicants must provide either an IDE exemption letter or a copy of the risk determination letter from the FDA. For devices, if the IRB has determined that the device is Non-Significant Risk, documentation from the IRB is acceptable.  (g) The study is of a non-regulated intervention, including surgical and behavioral interventions.

"NEI Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Cooperative Agreement for Early-Stage Clinical Trials with Greater than Minimal Risk (U44-Clinical Trial Required)","Purpose  This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant applications from small business concerns (SBCs) that propose to implement investigator-initiated clinical trials related to the research mission of the NEI. This program provides support for milestone-driven, commercialization-oriented clinical trials and will involve participation of NEI program staff in negotiating the final project plan before award and monitoring of research progress. Applications supported by this NOFO must meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html) and must be greater than minimal risk trials. As defined in 45 CFR § 46.102, a minimal risk trial is one in which the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.  The mission of the NEI is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. Applications considered for funding by the NEI must align with the NEI Strategic Plan.  Background  This NEI SBIR Cooperative Agreement (U44) for Clinical Trials is designed to support SBIR grant applications specifically from small business concerns (SBCs).  Currently, the NEI uses U01 cooperative agreement mechanism https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-149.html to support early-stage, small-scale clinical trials that are greater than minimal risk; and UG1 https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-041.html to support large-scale, multi-center clinical trials, human gene-transfer and stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource- or safety-risk clinical trials.  Scope  The scope of this NOFO is to support U44 applications for clinical trials to investigate the safety and/or efficacy of screening, diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic interventions for eye diseases or disorders. Applicants seeking a Phase II or Phase IIB award must have received an eligible predicate award that is appropriate and relevant (e.g., pre-clinical studies, planning activities, etc.) to this NOFO. An application without an eligible predicate award must be submitted as a Direct to Phase II application. This NOFO is specifically intended for early-stage clinical trials with greater than minimal risk that meet all of the following criteria:  Include strong preliminary and/or pre-clinical data Are early-stage clinical trials Have a well described Commercialization Plan (see Section IV for details) Examples of appropriate studies include, but are not limited to, those designed to:  Evaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability, or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in healthy volunteers or the target population. Evaluate whether an intervention produces sufficient evidence of short-term activity (e.g., biomarker activity, target engagement, dose-response trends, pharmacodynamic response) in a human “proof of concept” trial. Select or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy. Determining the optimal outcome measure (endpoint), its variability, and/or the optimal timing of outcome evaluations in the context of the intervention. Establish proof-of-principle and optimize techniques, operation, and usability of a device, inform the final device design decisions, and estimate the magnitude of treatment effects. Collecting information on the utility of questionnaires, rating scales, or biomarkers. This NOFO will support the conduct, completion, and analysis of a clinical trial, including activities related to the conduct of the clinical trial, which include but are not limited to the following:  training of study personnel enrollment and recruitment of study subjects investigational product costs data collection, management and quality control laboratory work and data analyses study management and oversight establishment of committees to manage the complexity of the trial preparation of the final study report and other related post-trial activities regulatory activities and site monitoring can be covered if required Clinical trial planning activities should be completed prior to the time of application submission and investigators must be ready to implement the proposed trial at the time of award. If the proposed clinical trial involves the use of a drug or a device that has not been approved by the FDA for the proposed investigational use, then evidence of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application submission to the FDA that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 312 is required at the time of the U44 grant application submission. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence from the FDA if an IND or an IDE is not required. NEI reserves the right to deny or postpone the award until evidence of IND/IDE authorization from FDA is provided.  Milestones  Delineation of milestones is a key characteristic of the NEI Cooperative Agreement (U44) for Early-Stage Clinical Trials with greater than Minimal Risk. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline, signifying the completion of a major project stage or activity. See Section IV. Application and Submission Information for more specific instructions.  Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO:  The following types of activities remain outside of the scope of this NOFO, and applications proposing such activities will be considered non-responsive to this NOFO and will be withdrawn without review:  Applications that do not meet NEI Mission: https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning Applications involving a clinical experiment that is not directly intended to evaluate a screening, diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic intervention Applications that aim to test a drug, a device, or service with limited or no commercialization potential NIH-defined clinical trial applications proposing only mechanistic and/or minimal risk studies Applications that are large-scale, multi-center clinical trials, human gene-transfer and stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource clinical trials Applications that propose a project that extends beyond a three-year project period Applications that propose animal studies Applications that lack appropriate attachments (See Other Attachments in Section IV. Application and Submission Information) Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DSMC)  A DSMC is required for this mechanism. The DSMC is an independent group composed of individuals not directly involved in patient care or data collection for the study who are responsible for safeguarding the interests of all trial participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of the treatment during the trial, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the trial. The DSMC operates under the guidance of an approved Charter.  Do not name individuals for the DSMC but include areas of expertise that will be pertinent in forming this committee. NEI reserves the right to specify the requirements for the establishment of a DSMC (Data and Safety Monitoring Committee). Applicants are encouraged to discuss those decisions and requirements with NEI prior to submission of the application.  Programmatic Oversight  NEI program staff will closely monitor progress in meeting the milestones of all projects funded by cooperative agreements under this NOFO and will also oversee the management and reporting of adverse events and have regular communications with the PD(s)/PI(s). The NEI Program Official(s) will participate in the DSMC meetings and will serve as a technical representative to the DSMC.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific/Research staff as plans for an application are being developed (see Section VII, Agency Contacts), and no later than 12 weeks prior to the anticipated application submission date.  All research and development activities associated with awards made under this NEI SBIR Cooperative Agreement for Early-Stage Clinical Trials with Greater than Minimal Risk (U44) NOFO must be performed within the United States (the United States is defined as the 50 States, the territories and possessions of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the District of Columbia).

"Interactive Digital Media (IDM) Biomedical Science Resources for Pre-College Students and Teachers (SBIR) (R43/R44 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","Interactive Digital Media (IDM) refers to products and services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user’s actions by presenting content in the form of text, images, animations, audios, videos, and video games. These products and services have been widely used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education to enrich student's learning experience both inside and outside of classroom settings.  This NOFO funds small business concerns (SBCs) to develop innovative IDM in the areas of biomedical science supported by NIH’s research mission. The products should be able to engage users for interactive learning experiences. They are expected to not only disseminate knowledge of biomedical science, but also enhance student's interest in learning more about biomedical science and related research, and to develop and strengthen student's problem-solving skills. IDM that develops students' quantitative and computational skills is particularly encouraged. The products may be designed for inside or outside of classroom use, for students individually or in a group setting, with or without teacher or adult participation or supervision. Features that allow real-time student assessment are strongly encouraged. While products serving all age or grade groups of pre-college students and their teachers in instructional roles are allowed, each product must be age, grade and culturally appropriate for its target audience, and developed on IDM platforms that are accessible to the target learner level.

"SBIR/STTR Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program Technical Assistance and Late Stage Development (SB1 Clinical Trial Required)","The NIH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs have provided the small business community with critical seed funding to support the development of a wide variety of technologies that benefit society. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II and Phase IIB it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II or Phase IIB award, it is expected that the SBC will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III. Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require support beyond the SBIR/STTR Phase II award to achieve commercialization. The development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap, known as the “Valley of Death,” between the end of the SBIR/STTR Phase II award and the commercialization stage.  A number of NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) participate in the Phase IIB program, which provides additional support to mitigate the funding gap with a second Phase II award. However, Phase IIB programs can be limited in the amount of outsourcing allowed and some projects require technical assistance and R&D studies that are typically outsourced to contract research organizations (CROs) (e.g. regulatory assistance, IND/IDE enabling studies, toxicology, manufacturing, clinical trials). Some SBCs also require additional funding beyond the Phase IIB to commercialize a technology or attract third party funding. In addition, SBIR/STTR awards may not support activities important for commercialization, such as product development and market planning, market research, and costs related to license agreements and partnerships.    The SBIR and STTR programs were reauthorized and extended through 2025 under Public Law 114-328, Section 1834, Public Law 115-232 and Public Law 117-183 including the reauthorization of the Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program to the NIH. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) aims to implement the CRP Program at NIH. The goal of this NOFO is to facilitate the transition of previously funded SBIR/STTR Phase II/IIB projects to the commercialization stage by providing additional support for later stage research and development (R&D) and product development not typically supported through Phase II or Phase IIB grants or contracts, often because they are normally outsourced to CROs.    This NOFO supports New “Type 1” Applications from recipient s with Phase II or IIB SBIR/STTR awards that have been active within the last 36 months, including those that will be active at the requested start date.    Please note: Only those applicants who have received Phase II or Phase IIB funding from NIH are eligible for this program, as described in Section III.1.    Phase II and Phase IIB recipient s with funding from a non-participating NIH Institute/Center should note that some NIH Institutes/Centers participate in the following:    The Phase IIB Competing Renewal supports those Phase II projects that require extraordinary time and effort in the research and development phase.

Scientific/Technical Scope    NIH ICs participating in this NOFO may accept applications based on any topic within their mission or based on specific topics. While general topic areas are listed below, applicants should read the specific interests of the ICs carefully prior to submission.    Topic areas appropriate for this NOFO include, but are not limited to, the following:    Technical Assistance:    Development of a regulatory strategy, including assembling the documentation needed to support a meeting request, filing of Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), or relevant marketing applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other relevant US Regulatory Agency.  Development of an intellectual property strategy, including analysis of the patent landscape in the US and abroad.  Technical assistance associated with manufacturing, including industrial production methods necessary to ensure consistent and controlled scale-up manufacturing according to recognized quality standards and in compliance with expected good manufacturing practices (GMPs).  Other technical assistance through a third-party technical assistance provider, including market research.  Late Stage Research and Development Activities:    Independent replication/confirmation of key studies.  Systematic research on development and optimization of industrial production methods necessary to ensure consistent and controlled scale-up manufacturing according to recognized quality standards and in compliance with expected good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and applicable FDA requirements, including measures and activities to control manufacturing of upstream and downstream processes, batch compounding, dosage form production, in-process sampling, testing, process validation and related production requirements.  Activities to bring the development process under Design and Quality Systems Control.  Animal studies to develop surgical techniques relevant to a device.  In vitro and animal testing to meet FDA recognized ISO/ASTM Standards.  Optimization of the device design with respect to the human functional anatomy.  Device, software, and firmware design verification and validation activities.  GLP compliant large animal studies.  Identification of the most simple, reliable, and cost-effective device configuration for more advanced clinical trials and eventual market approval.  Process optimization and synthesis, including development of analytical methods to determine drug purity and development of a clinical trial formulation.  IND/IDE enabling studies, including toxicology.  Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) activities for IND-enabling pharmacology/toxicology tests.  Pharmacokinetic/ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) studies.  Tumorigenicity, immunogenicity, mutagenicity and teratogenicity evaluations.  GMP manufacturing of clinical trial supplies.  Optimization of delivery systems.  Development and validation of biochemical assays required for clinical trials (e.g., pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and/or immunogenicity assays).  Clinical studies and clinical trials (Note: not every Institute or Center at NIH supports clinical trials through this NOFO . Please see below the section of Interests of Specific Institutes/Centers).  Unlike typical SBIR and STTR research and development grants or contracts, companies have the option of out-sourcing a significant portion of the work requested through the CRP, provided the expert services are appropriate for the work proposed and well justified in the application. The SBC should perform a substantive role in the oversight and management of the R&D proposed, including appropriate oversight of all scientific, programmatic, financial, and administrative matters related to the grant. Therefore, NIH expects the SBC to request enough funds to enable management of the activities.

"SBIR/STTR Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program Technical Assistance and Late Stage Development (SB1, Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","The NIH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs have provided the small business community with critical seed funding to support the development of a wide variety of technologies that benefit society. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II and Phase IIB it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II or Phase IIB award, it is expected that the SBC will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III. Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require support beyond the SBIR/STTR Phase II award to achieve commercialization. The development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap, known as the “Valley of Death,” between the end of the SBIR/STTR Phase II award and the commercialization stage.  A number of NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) participate in the Phase IIB program, which provides additional support to mitigate the funding gap with a second Phase II award. However, Phase IIB programs can be limited in the amount of outsourcing allowed and some projects require technical assistance and R&D studies that are typically outsourced to contract research organizations (CROs) (e.g. regulatory assistance, IND/IDE enabling studies, toxicology, manufacturing, clinical trials). Some SBCs also require additional funding beyond the Phase IIB to commercialize a technology or attract third party funding. In addition, SBIR/STTR awards may not support activities important for commercialization, such as product development and market planning, market research, and costs related to license agreements and partnerships.    The SBIR and STTR programs were reauthorized and extended through 2025 under Public Law 114-328, Section 1834, Public Law 115-232 and Public Law 117-183 including the reauthorization of the Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program to the NIH. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) aims to implement the CRP Program at NIH. The goal of this NOFO is to facilitate the transition of previously funded SBIR/STTR Phase II/IIB projects to the commercialization stage by providing additional support for later stage research and development (R&D) and product development not typically supported through Phase II or Phase IIB grants or contracts, often because they are normally outsourced to CROs.    This NOFO supports New “Type 1” Applications from recipients with Phase II or IIB SBIR/STTR awards that have been active within the last 36 months, including those that will be active at the requested start date.    Please note: Only those applicants who have received Phase II or Phase IIB funding from NIH are eligible for this program, as described in Section III.1.    Phase II and Phase IIB recipients   with funding from a non-participating NIH Institute/Center should note that some NIH Institutes/Centers participate in the following:    The Phase IIB Competing Renewal supports those Phase II projects that require extraordinary time and effort in the research and development phase.

"HEAL Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program: Embedded Entrepreneurs for Small Businesses in Pain Management (SB1 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","The goal of this FOA is to support the commercialization of SBIR/STTR-funded pain management technologies through the addition of an experienced entrepreneur within small business leadership teams and by supporting private fundraising and partnership activities. This Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) funding opportunity is specifically open to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II or Phase IIb awardees who are focused on advancing pain management therapies and technologies that have been funded by the HEAL Initiative or through HEAL-specific SBIR/STTR funding opportunities.    This FOA is part of the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative an aggressive, trans-agency effort to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at https://heal.nih.gov. More than 25 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, a highly debilitating medical condition that is complex and lacks effective treatments. In recent decades, there has been an overreliance on opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function. This contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid overdose deaths and addictions. Small Business support through the HEAL Initiative is dedicated to bringing innovative pain management technologies and treatments for pain to the market.    Due to their long and expensive development timelines, many pain management technologies, including small molecule and biologic analgesics, medical technologies, and diagnostics, require significant funding beyond federal support to reach the marketplace. Within small biotech companies, third-party funding is primarily achieved through attracting private investment and/or partnerships with industry. Successfully attracting private partners requires dedicated time, significant knowledge, and unique skillsets. Early-stage biotech companies formed by technical experts may lack experience in business development, fundraising, private partnership, and entrepreneurship. In addition, Small Business Concerns (SBCs) primarily supported through SBIR/STTR awards often lack funding for non-R&D activities, thus these SBCs may not be able to support the salaries of business development staff. Gaps in entrepreneurial and business development expertise within SBCs may negatively impact the likelihood of attracting private funding and ultimately delay or undermine commercialization of innovative pain management products. This FOA will prioritize applicants who demonstrate a need for private partnership to achieve commercialization of their pain management technologies, and SBCs who have not previously garnered significant private funding. Small businesses who have previously obtained private funding should provide a clear rationale as to why additional business management expertise and federal support of partnering goals are needed to support future private partnering. In demonstrating a need for federal support for successful private partnering, applicants should also address the relative accessibility of private partners in the geographical vicinity of the applying SBC.    The CRP Program is an authorized component of the SBIR and STTR programs. The CRP program permits utilization of SBIR/STTR set-aside funds to support eligible SBCs in conducting technical assistance activities which may not include an R&D component. In concordance with the CRP program, funding through this FOA is intended to facilitate the transition of previously funded SBIR/STTR Phase II and Phase IIb projects focused on pain management to the commercialization stage by supporting private partnering activities. Please note: Only those applicants who have received Phase II or Phase IIB funding from NIH are eligible for CRP funding, as described in Section III.1. Specifically, applying SBCs must have at least one of the following:    Phase II or IIB SBIR/STTR award that has ended within the last 36 months or will close out by the requested start date (""Type 2"" Renewal application).  Phase II or IIB SBIR/STTR award that will be active at the requested Project Start date (""Type 1"" New application).  Scope    This FOA is specifically designed to support addition of an expert in entrepreneurship and business development within small business leadership teams which currently lack this knowledge base, and to utilize this expertise in efforts to attract private funding. This FOA is designed to support applications with the following components within the Research Plan section of the application package (see Section IV for application instructions):    A detailed hiring plan to fill gaps in business expertise within the current small business leadership through hiring of a qualified individual  Clear identification of the specific skillsets and expertise missing from the current leadership team (or are only available in a leadership member with less than a 50% commitment) that must be filled to improve likelihood of attaining private partnering goals.  Methods by which at least three candidates filling the identified gaps in expertise will be identified, interviewed, and evaluated, including how the search will encourage applications from people of diverse backgrounds, including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, and women.  Identification of the executive level position, roles and responsibilities, anticipated compensation (including contributions of the applying small business), and level of effort (50%-100%) of the individual to be hired through this funding opportunity to fill identified gaps in expertise  Biosketches and letters of support from one or more candidates fitting the identified gaps in expertise, indicating the candidate supports the proposed leadership role, compensation, and partnering plan  A detailed partnering plan to attract private funding through private investment and/or partnership with industry (such as licensing or acquisition) the includes the following components:  A description of the types of private investors or industry partners that will be targeted and how they align with the company, pain management technology, and mission of the HEAL Initiative  Methods for identifying and contacting potential private partners  A timeline for execution of proposed activities extending throughout the proposed grant period  Interim goals or milestones throughout the grant period  This funding opportunity is intended to bolster the core competencies of NIH-funded SBC leadership teams in areas of business expertise and private partnering in an effort to improve success in private funding and partnering. Therefore, applicants are expected to incorporate this expertise into the SBC leadership team at a significant commitment of no less than 50% effort to the company. Note that the level of effort of this individual on the proposed project may be less than the overall commitment to the company. For example, the individual may be a full time hire and be proposed to contribute 50% effort to the activities proposed to this funding opportunity. Level of effort on the proposed project should be commensurate with the involvement of the individual in the proposed partnering activities. Award funding may only support the labor costs affiliated with the proposed activities. Applying small businesses are expected to contribute to the compensation of individual(s) hired through this award, such as through equity agreements or other funds.The proposed hire is expected to be responsible for significant portions of business development and private partnering activities, and therefore it is anticipated that executive positions such as Chief Business Officer (CBO), Chief Finance Officer (CFO), Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operations Officer (COO), Senior VP of Business Development, or similar may be appropriate. It is anticipated that relevant skillsets and expertise needed to conduct partnering activities may include a track record of raising venture funding to support development of related technologies and/or experience overseeing successful licensing of similar technologies to large industry partners. Ultimately, the skillsets of the proposed business executive hire should align with those needed to execute the proposed partnering plan.    While applying small businesses are not required to execute proposed hiring agreements prior to application submission, this FOA is designed to support applications that have identified at least one candidate within the application who provides the necessary expertise, along with a letter of support from the proposed candidate (see Section IV for application instructions). The application also requires a letter of support from this candidate confirming interest and their support of the proposed hiring plan and activities described in the application. Please note that funding for this award may be restricted until a candidate that meets the required skillsets and expertise is officially hired. Applicants are expected to describe efforts by which they will encourage applications from candidates of diverse backgrounds, including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, and women (see the Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html, for more information).. Applicants are highly encouraged to utilize their network of advisors, board members, and consultants to identify strong candidates.    Applicants should be actively seeking private funding or partnering at the time of application or within one year of application submission. Readiness for fundraising and/or partnering activities should be demonstrated, such as through inclusion of letters of support from private funders, industry, and advisors; prior engagement with private partners; prior participation in company showcase opportunities or pitch competitions; and/or examples of comparable technologies and companies who succeeded in partnering at a similar development stage.    Activities proposed within applications to this funding opportunity must be directly related to private fundraising and partnering activities. Partnering activities supported by this grant may include but are not limited to US-based travel to meet with potential partners, attendance at partnering meetings, legal activities related to partnering, and business development activities to address areas of interest of private partners (e.g. market and IP landscape analyses, regulatory plan development, business plan development, customer discovery research). Partnering goals or milestones may include completing a number of meetings with investors, establishing a board of directors, finalizing pitch decks, and other business development activities that directly serve the proposed partnering goals. This funding opportunity may support activities of other company staff, advisors, board members, consultants, lawyers, and/or vendors who will contribute to the proposed hiring and partnering activities.    Applicants are expected to meet with a minimum of ten potential partners over the duaration of the project fitting an appropriate target profile for the technology and company (e.g., angel investors, VC firms, pharma venture branches, industry search and evaluation staff, etc). Costs associated with conducting these meetings, including US-based travel and legal fees, are within scope. Activities outside of product R&D that may directly contribute to successful partnering are within scope, such as market and intellectual property (IP) analyses, regulatory plan development, assembling a data room, and business plan development. The contribution of these activities to partnering success should be made clear by the applicant.",PAR-23-069,"Phase II",SBIR,HHS,NIH,"September 6, 2025","January 3, 2023","March 5, 2023",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-069.html,Open,2023,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/10766
"Advancing Research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD) (R41/R42 Clinical Trial Optional)","Recommendations and milestones for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) research from the National Alzheimer’s Project Act and, the 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2021 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summits present a wide range of research and development proposals which, if pursued, have the potential to reduce the human burden and healthcare costs associated with AD/ADRD.    As part of the National Institute on Aging's (NIA) strategic plan to support the development of innovative strategies and therapies to prevent, diagnose, and treat AD/ADRD, this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications to NIA's Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. The aim of this FOA is to encourage research on, and the commercialization of, novel therapies, devices, products, and healthcare programs and practices to prevent the onset of AD/ADRD, and to reduce the burden that AD/ADRD places on individuals, their families, and society at large.

Clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of drug, nutritional, behavioral, cognitive, or other types of interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline and treat cognitive impairment and/or behavioral symptoms associated with MCI, AD/ADRD, and other dementias of aging, as well as to slow and/or reverse the course of AD/ADRD or to prevent their onset.  Care:    New technologies for in-home use or for coordination or delivery of services to sustain in-home living for individuals living with MCI or AD/ADRD. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:  Systems and devices to evaluate, monitor, improve, or adapt to changes in cognition;  Improvements in health-service delivery;  Improvements in the preservation of functional independence;  Technologies supporting independent living and the conduct of everyday tasks at home;  Provision of information to healthcare providers and family members enabling assessment of patient needs and/or intervention(s); and  Promotion of effective communication and interaction between individuals living with dementia in the community or in institutional settings and their healthcare providers, friends, and family members.  Assistive robotics technology that can support a person in order to maintain or improve their independence, safety, and well-being when diagnosed with AD/ADRD and alleviate the burden of care. Such efforts might include the development of socially-assistive robots that can support engagement, social participation, and leisure activities of patients living with MCI and AD/ADRD.  Cost-effective technology to create dementia-friendly cities and environments for individuals diagnosed with AD/ADRD. This might include the development of alarm technology and tracking and location-monitoring devices to alert caregivers and others of the whereabouts of individuals living with AD/ADRD. Other advances might include innovative research to develop safer home environments, such as automatic shut-off valves for water (e.g. a sink could overflow when one forgets to turn off faucet) and electricity and gas (e.g. forgetting to turn off stove).  Comprehensive telecare systems that can be used to support independence and personal safety of an individual living with AD/ADRD and other dementias. Such telecare systems might include community alarms, medication reminders, sensors for floods or extreme temperatures, detection of absence from normal activities (e.g. sitting in a chair, going to bed), fall detection, and unobtrusive sensors to monitor activities of daily living and vital signs that can be reported to a healthcare provider. Other advances might include the development of technology that would allow for in-place monitoring of individuals at all stages of AD/ADRD. Ideally, such information would be integrated with other patient-relevant data in EMR.  Wearable, mobile, or other technology to enable direct, objective, and continuous data capture of everyday functions in individuals living with AD/ADRD.  Recent reviews of relevant scientific literature revealed the presence of disparities of care between diverse racial and ethnic minority populations of individuals with AD/ADRD. To address such disparities, this FOA encourages research to develop educational training programs for physicians, nursing assistants, home-care aids, and long-term-care services. These programs would focus on training healthcare staff to provide culturally-appropriate care to the patient at the right time and in the right setting.  Tools:    Novel technologies to monitor, assist, or maintain daily functioning of older individuals living with AD/ADRD and other cognitive impairments.  Manuals and training materials for existing evidence-based interventions that reduce the burden of caregiving for AD/ADRD caregivers which can be used by community-based agencies and/or healthcare organizations.  A tool that could be sold to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to allow them to accurately project future costs of caring for patients living with AD/ADRD and other forms of dementia. Such a tool would be based on incidence and cost data and would be capable of being tailored for use by participating MA plans to address the unique demographics and risk characteristics of its coverage pool.  Technology and analytical tools to investigate genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and cell stress pathways in neurons and glia of the aging and AD/ADRD brain. Such efforts might include the development of molecular-imaging technology and/or chip-based technology for in-vitro and in-vivo analysis of gene, epigenome, proteostasis, lipidomics, and metabolomics and metabolic function in the normal aging brain and in AD/ADRD.  Improved technology for the analysis of structural and functional brain connectivity at the cell, neural circuitry, and global network levels to define the trajectory of changes in brain structure and function in aging and AD/ADRD. Such technology might include the development of non-invasive methods and novel probes that monitor and manipulate the plasticity of neural circuits in the adult and aged nervous system. Further advances might include the development of novel markers of neural stem-cell function (e.g., proliferation, migration, and differentiation) as well as methods to assess the integration and function of stem cells in the aging and/or diseased nervous system.  Chip-based tools modeling human AD/ADRD for applications in AD/ADRD drug screening and development. Development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AD/ADRD has proven to be a lengthy, costly, and relatively unproductive process, with drug attrition rates of over 90%. Several studies have indicated the lack of appropriate preclinical AD/ADRD models as one of the barriers for successful development of AD/ADRD therapeutics. Although animal models of AD/ADRD have helped our understanding of AD/ADRD pathogenesis to some extent, key genes and proteins that are critical to the pathogenesis of this disease exhibit many inherent species-specific differences and, consequently, there is a critical need for translation platforms that can accurately and reproducibly mimic the AD/ADRD phenotype in vivo and be amenable to high-content screening and assay applications. Recent advances in stem-cell technology allow for successful generation of human neural-progenitor cells from skin cells of normal and AD/ADRD patients. This technology could be exploited to develop cell-type-specific AD/ADRD disease models by replicating AD/ADRD pathobiology on microfluidic chips. These chips could then provide a novel AD/ADRD model system that could be used in the translation process to:  perform high-throughput screening for drug discovery and drug efficacy,  develop in situ assays for measuring predictive biomarkers, and  validate therapeutic target(s);  Approaches using artificial intelligence to assist with recruitment and monitoring of study participants for clinical trials of treatments or preventives for AD/ADRD.  Clinical Research Operations Management System    NIA supports a central resource to NIA staff and extramural investigators to facilitate/support the conduct and management of clinical research. This resource, the Clinical Research Operations Management System (CROMS), is a comprehensive data management system to support the business functions, management, and oversight responsibilities of NIA grants that support the conduct of clinical research with human subjects.

As part of the National Institute on Aging's (NIA) strategic plan to support the development of innovative strategies and therapies to prevent, diagnose, and treat AD/ADRD, this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)  invites applications to NIA's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. The aim of this FOA is to encourage research on, and the commercialization of, novel therapies, devices, products, and healthcare programs and practices to prevent the onset of AD/ADRD, and to reduce the burden that AD/ADRD places on individuals, their families, and society at large.    Examples of research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:    Prevention:    Behavioral, environmental, pharmacological, and nutritional interventions to prevent and/or remediate brain biochemical and/or neurophysiological changes caused by neurodegenerative diseases, including age-related sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or age-related decrements in balance and postural control, gait performance, and mobility.  Programs to support cognitive training to improve cognitive function in the elderly. Examples of topics appropriate for such programs include, but are not limited to, the following:  Rapid development of novel, engaging, computer-based cognitive-training programs based on empirically-established approaches using cognitive training to target a specific neural system/functional domain;  Augmentation of existing computerized cognitive interventions that can be individually tailored to engage, adapt, challenge, and optimize functional cognitive abilities to enhance cognitive functioning and performance of activities of daily living; and  Development of interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline, especially using technology platforms with wide acceptance among older adults.  Diagnosis:    Sensitive, specific, and standardized tests for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, including the development of new, cost-effective, minimally-invasive biomarkers that could be used for screening in the general population and in community settings. In addition, this FOA encourages research that would identify new biomarkers that could serve as surrogate measures for disease progression in AD/ADRD. Other advances might include the development of new instrumentation, imaging technology, related devices, and software packages for use in visualizing neural activity during cognitive, emotional, motor, or sensory behavior in older adults.  Biosensors and prosthetic devices, technologies, and related software development to aid in the assessment, diagnosis, and remediation of age-related cognitive decline.  Machine-learning tools and cognitive batteries that can be integrated into Electronic Medical Records (EMR) for diagnosis of MCI and AD/ADRD.  New approaches for the assessment of persons living with multiple chronic conditions in clinical practice, including development and validation of brief cognitive-screening measures.  Treatment:    Discovery, development, and/or evaluation of drugs and/or biological or natural products, including central nervous system delivery systems, to remediate age-related cognitive decline and treat the cognitive impairment and/or behavioral symptoms associated with MCI, AD/ADRD, and other dementias of aging. In addition, this FOA invitess research on therapies that might slow and/or reverse the course of AD/ADRD, or prevent them entirely through the application of systems-biology and systems-pharmacology approaches. Therapeutics addressing novel targets are of particular interest.

"Late-Stage Translation of Biomedical and Behavioral Research Results in Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases from Academic/Non-profit Lab to Marketplace (SBIR [R43/R44] Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","Purpose  This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages the translation of technology and therapeutic innovations from academic and other non-profit research sectors to the marketplace to advance the development of diagnostic and prevention tools or treatments for musculoskeletal, rheumatic, or skin diseases. Small Business Concerns (SBCs) are encouraged to apply for this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant award to support late-stage translation of their work and move the lab technologies towards commercial dissemination. Applications to this FOA must describe partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and SBCs, which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple Program Directors/Principal Investigators and/or employing researchers from the original institutions in the SBCs.  The NIAMS/NIH and other research sponsors have invested a significant amount of funds in developing new technologies to study musculoskeletal, rheumatic, and skin diseases from basic, translational, and clinical perspectives through a variety of mechanisms, such as the NIH R01, R15, R21, R61, and P50, as well as NIH Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) Awards. These investments have produced a large amount of intellectual property for new technologies including drug candidates, biomarkers, diagnostic tools, and tissue engineering products. Since commercialization of a new technology or a potentially new therapeutic is a complex process, academic investigators with a focus on theoretical and mechanistic studies may not have the capacity to translate lab technology concepts into products for clinical use. Consequently, these concepts for new technologies and drugs may slowly or never advance to commercial dissemination. This FOA is intended to utilize the NIH SBIR grant mechanism to move these innovations in NIAMS mission-relevant research from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace through collaborations between small businesses and non-commercial laboratories.  Research Objectives and Scope  This initiative will support late-stage pre-clinical studies on technology or therapy feasibility, and studies that are required for regulatory approval before clinical testing and making new lab technologies more practical for clinical use. Applications may include human subjects research; however, clinical trials are excluded. Applicants could propose to analyze samples from affected subjects and controls, conduct subject interviews, or other procedures of clinical research.  For the purpose of this initiative, a late-stage translation is the continuation of previous research work that has shown promising data for development of a product. It is expected that the academic/non-profit labs have conducted mechanistic studies and obtained preliminary results that provide a strong premise to further develop the technology or therapy. The concept of a product should be well defined.  NIAMS mission-relevant research topics include, but are not limited to:  Development of therapies such as drugs, biologics, devices, cells, genes or behavioral interventions  Development of innovative strategies for the delivery of drugs  Biomarker studies focusing on changes in disease-associated biochemistry, imaging, physiology, or other measures that would facilitate screening and diagnosis  Development of outcome measures and methodologies that would enhance future observational studies and clinical trials  Development of 3D human tissue models for studying pathogenesis and/or testing new therapeutics  Collaboration Between Academic/Non-profit Lab and SBCs  Commercialization of academic/non-profit lab research results is normally supported by the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, in which the research institutions can significantly contribute to the research and development. This FOA specifically encourages late-stage translation to be completed mostly by the small businesses. A collaboration between academic/non-profit labs and SBCs is encouraged, and the academic/non-profit lab can perform a portion of the project in accordance with the SBIR policy. This initiative also encourages academic researchers to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship. A technology transfer agreement between the research institution and the SBC should be in place.  Milestones  NIH emphasizes rigor and reproducibility of observed results. This FOA will support duplication of the critical experiments/tests in a new setting (e.g., a different device model, a 3D human tissue model) to demonstrate the feasibility of a technology for commercialization or to support FDA approval for clinical trial. Because development of a new technology or therapy is inherently high-risk, attrition is anticipated as projects move through the process. To help mitigate this risk, applications must propose one or more milestones associated with each of the research plan's objectives in each phase of the project. Milestones are goals that measure success and/or efficacy that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project, and should have quantitative success criteria and an associated rationale for each. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art of the field. Details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured) should be included for each milestone. Each milestone must have a timeline and be incorporated into the overall project timeline, which should also be reflected in a Gantt chart.  Applications Not Responsive to This FOA  Examples of research that are not responsive to this FOA include:  applications that propose research and development that is not originated from an academic/non-profit lab applications that propose to conduct intervention studies Non-responsive applications will be returned without review.",PAR-23-032,BOTH,SBIR,HHS,NIH,"September 6, 2025","October 27, 2022","December 5, 2022",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/PA-files/PAR-23-032.html,Open,2023,https://www.sbir.gov/topics/9686
