This proposal's focus on data analysis and algorithm development for remote data streams is directly applicable.\n- CV PI Alfredo Costilla Reyes 04-2025.pdf: This document can be used to showcase Alfredo's expertise in biomedical engineering, wearable sensors, and VLSI, highlighting his qualifications for leading a project focused on developing and implementing sensor-based solutions for studying transport phenomena in space.\n- COSTILLAREYES-DISSERTATION-2020.pdf: The dissertation likely contains foundational research related to sensor design, data acquisition, and analysis, which can be cited and adapted to support the proposed methodology for the ISS experiment.\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. **Thoroughly Review the Full Program Solicitation:** Carefully read the entire NSF/CASIS Transport Phenomena Research at the International Space Station to Benefit Life on Earth (NSF25-529) solicitation to fully understand the program's specific goals, eligibility requirements, review criteria, and submission guidelines.\n2. **Identify Specific Transport Phenomena to Study:** Based on his expertise and the program's priorities, Alfredo should identify specific transport phenomena that can be effectively studied using wearable sensors and remote sensing technologies on the ISS. Consider phenomena relevant to biomedical engineering or remote asset monitoring, bridging his existing work with the space-based research environment.\n3. **Develop a Preliminary Research Plan and Contact the Program Officer:** Outline a preliminary research plan, including the specific sensors to be used, the data analysis methods, and the expected outcomes. Contact the program officer listed in the solicitation to discuss the feasibility of the proposed research and obtain feedback on the alignment with the program's goals.\n"
